## Specifications Subject to Change:

The information contained in this manual is believed to be correct at
the time of printing. However, Arturia reserves the right to change or
modify any of the specifications without notice or obligation to update
the hardware that has been purchased.

## IMPORTANT:

The product and its software, when used in combination with an
amplifier, headphones or speakers, may be able to produce sound levels
that could cause permanent hearing loss. DO NOT operate for long periods
of time at a high level or at a level that is uncomfortable.

If you encounter any hearing loss or ringing in the ears, you should
consult an audiologist.

## NOTICE:

Service charges incurred due to a lack of knowledge relating to how a
function or feature works (when the product is operating as designed)
are not covered by the manufacturer’s warranty, and are therefore the
owner's responsibility. Please study this manual carefully and consult
your dealer before requesting service.

## Precautions include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.  Read and understand all the instructions.
2.  Always follow the instructions on the instrument.
3.  Before cleaning the instrument, always remove the USB cable. When
    cleaning, use a soft and dry cloth. Do not use gasoline, alcohol,
    acetone, turpentine or any other organic solutions; do not use a
    liquid cleaner, spray or cloth that's too wet.
4.  Do not use the instrument near water or moisture, such as a bathtub,
    sink, swimming pool or similar place.
5.  Do not place the instrument in an unstable position where it might
    accidentally fall over.
6.  Do not place heavy objects on the instrument. Do not block openings
    or vents of the instrument; these locations are used for air
    circulation to prevent the instrument from overheating. Do not place
    the instrument near a heat vent at any location with poor
    air circulation.
7.  Do not open or insert anything into the instrument that may cause a
    fire or electrical shock.
8.  Do not spill any kind of liquid onto the instrument.
9.  Always take the instrument to a qualified service center. You will
    invalidate your warranty if you open and remove the cover, and
    improper assembly may cause electrical shock or other malfunctions.
10. Do not use the instrument with thunder and lightning present;
    otherwise it may cause long distance electrical shock.
11. Do not expose the instrument to hot sunlight.
12. Do not use the instrument when there is a gas leak nearby.
13. Arturia is not responsible for any damage or data loss caused by
    improper operation of the instrument.

# Introduction

**Congratulations on your purchase of the Arturia MatrixBrute!**

The MatrixBrute is designed to be a supremely powerful, modern analog
classic synthesizer.

The roots of this product stem from the greatest synthesizers of all
time, all enhanced with Arturia’s own modern touch and character. The
now famous ‘Brute’ style oscillators, paired with the classic sounds of
both the Steiner Parker filter and Dr. Bob Moog ladder filter, and our
own analog effects section, give you a wealth of tools and amazing sonic
character to build your own sounds up.

The center point of the MatrixBrute is the impressive Matrix Modulation,
that the name is derived from. This matrix allows you to take control
and route modulation sources in a near endless amount of ways. Couple
this with the preformance features of the sequencer, arpeggiator,
assignable macro knobs and the vast CV connectivity and you have a
product the will be the center piece in your studio or stage set up.

We are proud and thrilled to bring you this iconic synthesizer. It is
the fusion of the programable analog synthesizer wants and dreams of our
entire development team.

Be sure to visit the www.arturia.com website and check for the latest
firmware, download the MIDI Control Center and check out the tutorials
and FAQs. Get ready to explore synthesis in a whole new way.

Musically yours,
**The Arturia team**
