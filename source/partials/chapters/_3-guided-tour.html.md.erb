Guided Tour
===========

The following walkthrough will give you a solid foundation for the
MatrixBrute. After this you'll have a good understanding of what you're
doing when you create and shape sounds.

Subtractive synthesis overview
------------------------------

MatrixBrute is an analog subtractive synthesizer. Subtractive synthesis
starts by generating basic waveforms, and then you remove what you don't
want to sculpt the timbre you're after. MatrixBrute can also use
external sounds as basic waveforms, and then process them through its
engines.

The basic signal flow is simple:

- VCO (voltage-controlled oscillators) **\[page \#\]** generate various
kinds of waveforms. These are on a black background on the MatrixBrute
panel;

- VCF (voltage-controlled filters) **\[page \#\]** shape the harmonic
content, but they can also self-oscillate to become sound sources. For
that reason, they're also on a black background;

- An extensive list of modifiers, identified by a charcoal-colored
background, move the other parameters around over time in various ways.
In some cases, modulators can control other modulators.

One of the main features in the MatrixBrute is... its Matrix (hence the
name). This is an electronic modulation-routing patchbay, so everything
that could be a source can be routed to any and all possible destination
parameters. Some modulation sources you move physically, such as the
modulation wheel; others can either run freely or lock to the internal
sequencer's clock. Or they can lock to MIDI.

Triggers from the 4-octave keyboard and the sequencer/arpeggiator - as
well as incoming MIDI notes - could also be considered modifiers when
they're doing more than just playing notes.

The final module in the MatrixBrute's audio path is an analog effects
section, and the output levels and master tuning are separate from the
synthesis engine.

Throughout an analog synthesizer, frequencies are controlled by voltage.
MatrixBrute uses 24V per octave, so for example from C3 to C4 is a 24V
increase, and from C3 to F\#3 is a 12V increase.

Initializing a Preset
---------------------

![](images/media/image11.png)

Start with an initialized sound: **Panel + Preset**.

Hands On
--------

MatrixBrute has more than one of every type of module, but it's only
necessary to go through one of each for this bird's-eye view. So we'll
just use one VCO, one VCF, one LFO, one envelope.

### VCO 1

Play the keyboard, and you'll hear a buzzy sound. If you don't, push
Preset to toggle to the initialized sound.

![](images/media/image12.png)

Turn **VCO 1** up all the way, everything else all the way down in the
mixer. These are all the waveforms available for processing, and we're
only working with VCO 1.

Keep pressing VCO 1's **Filter** button until it's only routed to the
red one, the Steiner filter. Oscillators must be routed to a filter to
be audible.

![](images/media/image13.png)

Now that you're hearing VCO 1 on its own, move the **Coarse** knob to
hear what it sounds like at different pitches.

There are four different waveforms in this VCO - a Sub oscillator that
sounds an octave below the other three. Each wave generator has a level
knob on the bottom row and an enhancer for it on the top.

Turn all four down, then bring each one in one at a time so you can
hear the different waveforms. Try the enhancers to hear their effects on
the waveforms.

For now, leave everything at 12 o'clock. It doesn't matter that this
isn't a great sound.

### VCF 1

![](images/media/image14.png)

Now to shape the sound's timbre with VCF 1.

Sweep the **Master Cutoff** knob while playing. (VCF 1's Cutoff knob
has the same effect when you're only listening to one filter; the Master
controls both together.)

With the initialized setting, the filter is set to lowpass, meaning it
removes high frequencies. Cutoff selects the *corner frequency*, which
is where it starts operating. This has a radical effect on the timbre of
the sound.

Notice that there's no sound when you turn the way down (because you're
blocking all the frequencies from passing). You'd think the VCO, the
sound waveform generator, would be what turn the sound on and off - and
it does - but sounds can also be controlled by opening up a filter.

Bring up the **Brute Factor** knob, and experiment it, and with
**Drive**. It's not necessary to point out that you're adding some real
testosterone to the sound. The **Resonance** control adds more
brightness. You can leave VCF 1 set where it sounds good.

The sound in its present state is just on/off, which is what you want
for, say, organ sounds. We'll adjust that next.

### ENV 2

![](images/media/image15.png)

Envelopes shape voltage levels over time while you're triggering a note
on the keyboard. While it can be routed to additional places in the MOD
Matrix (see below), ENV 2 is always hardwired to control the
MatrixBrute's VCAs. VCA stands for voltage-controlled amplifiers, which
means all the sound sources that appear in the Mixer, i.e. the VCOs
and/or any external signals plugged into the back of the instrument.

- Start by raising ENV 2's **Attack** slider all the way up and down to
"catch" the fader's actual position. Play the keyboard while gradually
raising it. This has the effect of fading in the note. A quarter of the
way seems like a reasonable setting.

- The middle two stages of the envelope, **Decay** and **Sustain**, are
set to one-size-fits-all settings in the initialized patch we started
from. Attack is how long it takes the voltage to fade in to its initial
level. From there, Decay sets how long it takes to glide to its Sustain
level, which can be higher or lower than the Attack level (usually
lower).

- Now for the **Release** stage of this 4-stage envelope
(Attack/Decay/Sustain/Release, or ADSR). This sets how fast the note
fades out when you release the key. Again, a quarter of the way up might
be a reasonable setting.

- Notice how every note plays at the same volume, no matter how hard you
play the keyboard? The **Velo/VCA** fader lets you dial in how
responsive the envelope is to keyboard *velocity*, which is what
electronic keyboards use to determine how hard you intended to play.

When the slider is all the way down, every note plays at full volume;
all the way up, and you have to slam the keyboard to get it to speak up.
See whether you like three quarters of the way up.

The MatrixBrute has two other Envelopes. ENV 1 is hardwired to the two
filters' Cutoffs. It works the same way, so you can experiment with its
effect.

### LFO/Aftertouch/Matrix

Next, how to route modulation sources in the Matrix, including the LFOs.

Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs) are periodic waveforms just like VCOs,
only they're very low - which by definition means they're very slow.
Rather than being used as sound sources, LFOs 1 & 2 are used as
modifiers to add movement to other parameters. (However, VCO3 is
intended to be used as both a sound source and a modifier.)

![](images/media/image16.png)

Press the **MOD** button. The Matrix becomes an electronic patchbay.

We're going to route LFO 1 to VCO1's pitch. Depending on the settings,
this can create anything from a vibrato effect, to subtle movement, to
some really crazy stuff.

Like all modifiers (other than the hardwired envelopes), LFO 1 has to be
routed before it does anything. Modulation sources are on the rows on
the left of the Matrix, destinations are columns across the top.

![](images/media/image17.png)

LFO 1 is five rows down, VCO 1 Pitch is the first column, so simply
push the button where the two intersect. The button lights purple,
indicating it's the one that's selected; if you click on another button
to select additional modulation routings, it'll turn blue to show it's
been assigned.

![](images/media/image18.png)

LFO 1 still won't modulate the pitch until you dial in a **MOD
Amount**. Try + or -13, a fairly radical pitch modulation, so you can
hear the effect.

![](images/media/image19.png)

You'll also need to set LFO 1's **Phase** and **Rate** knobs where
they're audible, so try 12 o'clock as a starting point (as usual, after
sweeping them to catch their actual voltage positions).

The pitch should oscillate up and down when you play.

Increase the **MOD Amount** to + or - 64, and it'll sound sci-fi. This
is a good setting to experiment with the **Wave** buttons to understand
what they do.

MatrixBrute's LFOs have a choice of seven LFO waveforms, and you may be
surprised to see that they sound just like they look. Some of the same
waveforms are available in the VCOs, where they go by much faster, so
this is a good way to get a handle on how they sound.

Now the **MOD Amount** back to about 13, a vibrato effect.

The MatrixBrute's keys are pressure-sensitive. This is called
Aftertouch, a controller source when you push down the keys after the
note has sounded. We're going to use Aftertouch to increase LFO 1's rate
a lot to bring in some reedy growl.

Aftertouch is next to the letter J, but LFO 1's rate isn't one of the 12
hardwired modulation destinations. Columns 13 - 16 are user-assignable
to pretty much any parameter on the instrument.

![](images/media/image20.png)

- Hold down button **13**, then wiggle **LFO 1 Rate** a little. The LCD
display will darken and lighten, and LFO 1 Rate will appear in its
display to indicate that it's assigned.

![](images/media/image21.png)

- Now touch the button at the intersection of Aftertouch (J) and 13. Set
its MOD Amount to + 99.

Play a fairly low note, then press the key more to bring in aftertouch,
and you'll hear LFO 1 adding some soft growl.

### Analog Effects

![](images/media/image22.png)

The operation instructions cover the MatrixBrute's Analog Effects in
detail **\[page \#\]**, but just to "finish" the sound and bring this
module to your attention, turn the **Wet/Dry** knob up a little to add
some space. Use the **Mode** button to try other effects.
