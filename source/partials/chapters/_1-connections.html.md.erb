Panel Release latch - Push, then use the hinged prop inside the case to
set the control panel at the most convenient angle. You can also leave
the panel flat.

**1. Master Out** - 1/4" TS +10dBV stereo line-level outputs,
intended to go to an amp and speakers, or to an audio interface or
mixer. For mono use the left channel only.

**2. Insert Send/Return** - 1/4" TRS jack for sending the output of the
synth (mono) to an external processor and back in. This goes before the
Master Out in the signal path. It requires an insert cable, wired: Tip =
Send, Ring = Return, Sleeve = Ground.

**3. CV Ins/Outs** - 3.5mm control voltage outputs and inputs for being
controlled/controlling by modular synthesizers. 12 parameters are
available (VCA, LFO 1 Amount, Ladder Filter Cutoff, Steiner Filter
Cutoff, VCO 2 Metal, Pulse Width, Ultra, Pitch; VCO 1 Metal, Pulse
Width, Ultra, Pitch).

**4. Input** - External input. Run external instruments through the
MatrixBrute's synthesis engine.

**5. Input Type (Inst/Line)** - For external instrument, use Instrument
level for Hi-Z sources like an electric guitar or bass; use Line level
for -10dBV sources such as another electronic instrument, mixer output,
or turntable preamp output.

**6. Gain** - Level control for external instrument input, used in
conjunction with the Gate (\#7).

**7. Audio Gate (Off/On)** - A gate extractor that allows you to use
external audio signals, like a guitar, to trigger the envelope
generators. The Gain control (\#6) adjusts the level of the instrument
relative to this threshold.

**8. Gate In/Out** - Receives/sends a voltage trigger, usually to/from
another analog synthesizer. Use it to trigger the MatrixBrute from
another source, such as an analog drum machine.

**9. Sync In/Out** - Interfaces MatrixBrute with pre-MIDI instruments
that were capable of synchronization, such as early Korg and Roland drum
machines.

The following types of clock signals work: 1 step (Clock - this is the
default); 1 step (Gate); 24 pulses per quarter note; 48 pulses per
quarter note.

**10. Expression 1, 2; Sustain** - Pedal inputs. Expression 1 and 2 are
for continuously variable expression pedals (sometimes called volume
pedals), Sustain is for a momentary on/off pedal (i.e. a sustain pedal).
Some manufacturers reverse the polarity of their pedals; download the
MIDI Control Center software from www.Arturia.com to correct the
polarity of any of them. These pedals are converted to MIDI, so they
appear in the MIDI Out datastream.

**11. Memory Protection On/Off** - When off, prevents the MatrixBrute's
patch Preset and sequencer Pattern memories from being overwritten.

**12. MIDI In/Out/Thru** - Standard 5-pin DIN jacks. Connect to MIDI
interfaces and other equipment.

**13. USB** - USB B jack for connecting MatrixBrute to a Mac or PC
(which normally have USB A connections; the cable is often called a
"printer cable.") This lets you use Arturia's MIDI Control Center
software (available from www.Arturia.com), and it also sends/receives
MIDI - no additional MIDI interface is required.

**14. Power switch** - Turn the instrument on and off.

**15. AC jack**
