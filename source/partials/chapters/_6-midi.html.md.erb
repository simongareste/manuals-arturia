# MIDI

In addition to the keyboard, almost all MatrixBrute's knobs, sliders,
and wheels send and respond to MIDI, so you can record and edit their
movements in a DAW running on a computer. That makes the instrument
useful as a hands-on controller for external instruments, not just a
master keyboard.

MIDI can go in and out the USB port, the 5-pin DIN ports, both, or
neither. All the MIDI settings are in Arturia's MIDI Control Center
Mac/PC program, which you download from www.Arturia.com. (See below.)

The sequencer and arpeggiator can lock to MIDI clock. They send MIDI
notes, so you can record and edit the notes they send in a DAW. Since
the LFOs can lock to MIDI and then be patched anywhere, effectively
everything on the instrument can be in tempo.

## MIDI Continuous Controller Assignments

![](images/media/image66.png)

In the graphic above, the numbers superimposed over knobs are all MIDI
Continuous Controllers (CC), so for example the Modulation wheel
sends/receives MIDI CC\#1, and Macro knob 1 to its right sends/receives
CC\#11 (Expression).

While the Pitch wheel is unmarked, it is active; pitch isn't a CC in the
MIDI protocol - it's a separate command in the protocol. If you connect
expression pedals 1 or 2 to the rear panel, they have duplicate CC
assignments to Macro knobs 3's and 4's (to the left of the keyboard).
The Sustain pedal input in the rear is CC\#64, which is standard.

##  MIDI Control Center settings

The MIDI settings are all using the MIDI Control Center's **Device**
tab. Again, download the software from www.Arturia.com.

- *Input MIDI Channels* - All, 1-16, none. MaxiBrute sends and receives on one 16-channel MIDI port.

- *Output MIDI Channel* - 1-16. Choose between the 16 MIDI channels to send on.

- *MIDI clock source* - USB, MIDI, Sync. The USB port is the MaxiBrute's
 built-in MIDI interface, which you connect to a Mac or PC; MIDI is the
 5-pin DIN MIDI in.
 
- Use the Sync port to interface with pre-MIDI devices, such as old Korg
 and Roland drum machines. The following types are supported: the
 default is 1 pulse per step, 2 pulse per quarter note (Korg Volca), 24
 pulses per quarter note (Roland DIN), and 48 pulses per quarter note
 DIN.
- *MIDI param send and receive* - Turns MIDI from the panel on and off.
 The keyboard still sends notes when it's off. You might not want the
 knobs and sliders to trigger or respond to MIDI from another
 instrument while you're playing.

- *MIDI out select* - The choices are Off, USB, MIDI, or MIDI + USB. USB
 has the advantage of connecting directly to a Mac or PC without a MIDI
 interface, but you can run MIDI cables over longer distances. Also
 note that if you save a DAW project that used the USB connection, then
 load it again later, the DAW may get upset if the MatrixBrute isn't
 connected and turned on; it'll be looking for a MIDI interface it
 doesn't see.
 
- *Local control* - Local off means all the panel controls and the
 keyboard get sent out over MIDI, but they're disconnected from the
 MatrixBrute. This is convenient if you're working with a DAW; you'll
 hear the keyboard and controls on the MatrixBrute when its track is
 selected and MIDI is being sent back to trigger it, but you won't hear
 it when DAW tracks assigned to other instruments are selected. You can
 then play other instruments from the MatrixBrute without it playing
 along. Also, the MatrixBrute can be playing back MIDI you've recorded
 while you play other instruments from its keyboard and controls.


- *Program Change Receive* - MIDI Program Change commands switch
 Presets. That can be convenient, or you can turn it off to prevent
 Presets from changing when you don't want them to.


- *Pedal 1, Pedal 2, Footswitch polarity* - The choices are Normal and
 Inverted. Some manufacturer's pedals are reversed, so higher is lower
 and off is on. This corrects for that.


- *Pot mode* - Because the knobs are 270 pots and not 360 degree
 encoders, they don't necessarily reflect their underlying settings,
 there are three choices for how they behave when sending MIDI.


- *Jump* means a knob sends the value of its physical position as soon
 as you move it, regardless of its underlying setting. If the
 underlying setting is 12, the knob happens to be at 3, and you move it
 to 4, it will jump to 4. (These are not actual numbers.)

- *Hook* waits until you move a knob past its current setting to
 "catch" (hook) it before sending anything. This is the default mode.

- *Scaled* increases or decreases the actual setting regardless of
 where the knob is. So if the actual value is 12 and you move the knob
 from 3 to 4, the actual value will go to 13. Scaled allows you to
 increment or decrement the knob value. The drawback is if the knob is
 at a high or low extreme, you obviously cannot move it further. In
 this case you need to turn the knob and the value will have to go
 either negative or positive first.

- *Velocity curve* - This lets you adjust the keyboard response to your
 playing style and preference.

- *Linear* (the default) has an even response across the dynamic
 range;

- *Log* requires the least amount of force to play louder notes, but
 it's harder to control the dynamics at lower levels;

- *Exponential* is less jumpy at lower dynamic levels, but it takes
 more force to reach high dynamic levels.

- *Sequencer/Arp Sends Notes* - (On/Off) The sequencer/arpeggiator can
 send MIDI notes to trigger other instruments or to be recorded in a
 DAW.
