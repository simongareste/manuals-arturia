### Key Range Fade Up & Down

The **Key Range Fade Up & Down** is a gradual volume shift over a number
of keys allowing crossfading between sounds on different Partials. The
volume of each Partial can start at a low volume and increase/decrease
as you play up/down the keyboard.

To **determine** a **Fade** **Up** range for a selected Partial or set
of **grouped** Partials, click on the LEFT most vertical **Green** line
towards the TOP (the little HAND icon will pop up) and drag it RIGHT to
the key you choose to end the **Fade Up**. The vertical line will become
diagonal as you drag it. You will also see the corresponding key on the
keyboard at the bottom illuminate to a light BLUE.

To **determine** a **Fade** **Down** range for a selected Partial or set
of **grouped** Partials, click on the RIGHT most vertical **Green** line
towards the TOP and drag it LEFT to the key you choose to begin the
**Fade Down**. The vertical line will become diagonal as you drag it.
You will also see the corresponding key on the keyboard at the bottom
illuminate to a light BLUE.

Time Slices
-----------

The **TIME SLICES** Tab is located at the top left of the **Graphic
Screen Mode**, just to the RIGHT of the **KEY DYNAMICS** Tab.

![](//images/synclavier-v/image82.png){width="4.344444444444444in"
height="1.913888888888889in"}

TIME SLICES Tab (Graphic Screen Mode)

The **TIME SLICES** section allows Graphic and Numeric parameter control
for ONLY the selected **Partial**. This is where you enter 24 Harmonic
Coefficients for both Carrier and Modulator waves (or choose a preset
waveform) for both Carrier and Modulator waves, and create **TIME**
**SLICE** **FRAMES**. A **FRAME**, similar to a **film** frame, can
contain up to 24 harmonic coefficients, with individual phases for each,
for both the FM Carrier and FM Modulator waveforms.

**TIME SLICE FRAMES** are then “chained” together and evolve over time.
Beginning with the **BASIC PARTIAL**, a total of 50 **TIME SLICE
FRAMES** can be created.

### Anatomy of a TIMBRE SLICE FRAME Event

Synclavier V creates sound in response to MIDI Note-On events. The 12
Partial Timbres occur simultaneously; each Partial Timbre is
independent.

The precise point in time when the MIDI Note-On event is received
establishes the precise timing for the entire note. Scientifically
speaking, this point in time is referred to as Time T = 0.

At Time T = 0 Synclavier V begins by creating the **Delay** segment of
the Volume Envelope (if any). During the **Delay** segment no audio is
created for the Partial Timbre.

The creation of audible audio starts at the end of the **Delay**
segment. Scientifically speaking, this point in time is referenced as
Time T = D (where D is the Delay Time). At the end of the **Delay**
segment is when Synclavier V begins the **Attack** segment.

Both the **TIME SLICE FRAME** splicing and the Index Envelope begin
precisely at the start of the Volume Envelope attack. Of course, both
functions can be delayed by setting their own **Delay** parameter
appropriately.

The parameters associated with **FRAME 0** are applied to the audio at
the very start of the note (that is, at the end of the Volume Envelope
**Delay** segment). After the **FRAME 0** Frame Delay Time the waveform
will begin a **CROSSFADE** to the waveform associated with the next
“enabled” FRAME, typically **FRAME 1**. Additionally, the volume,
modulation or pitch will begin moving towards the setting associated
with **FRAME 1**.

Each of 12 **PARTIAL**s are available on the LEFT hand side of the
screen. You can make changes to one Partial at a time.

-   To select a **PARTIAL**, simply click on the PARTIAL (\#1-12) you’d
    like to change. It will be highlighted in **light Green**.

-   To listen to a PARTIAL individually, click on the small **S**
    (**Solo**) button just to the right of the PARTIAL number.

-   To turn off the sound of an individual Partial, click on the small
    **M** (**Mute**) button, just to the right of the Partial number.

### CARRIER & MODULATOR

To create or modify a waveform, **t**he **CARRIER** & **MODULATOR**
sections allow entry and modifying of 24 harmonic coefficients using
vertical **light Green** columns. You may also choose a preset waveform
**CARRIER** or **MODULATOR** wave.

#### Adding Harmonics (CARRIER)

Select the **PARTIAL** on the LEFT side of the Graphic Screen***.*** In
the **Time Slice** rectangle box the **BASIC PARTIAL** is **FRAME** 0

Timbre, click/dragging UP/DOWN in the **Time Slice** box will select
through them. (For more on creating and modifying additional FRAMES, see
Section 7.3.3.5 below)

![](//images/synclavier-v/image83.tiff){width="3.713888888888889in"
height="4.381443569553806in"}

To add or delete Harmonics, simply click on any of the LONG vertical
**Green** columns under **CARRIER**. Click/dragging the **Green** column
VERTICALLY changes the volume level of the chosen Harmonic. If you
click/drag in a sweeping motion HORIZONTALLY, multiple Harmonics can be
added or modified at once. A little experimentation and you will quickly
catch on.

The **HARMONICS SELECT** (just to the RIGHT of the **TOOLS** selector)
is a drop-down menu allowing you to choose a Coefficients Restriction
option when editing the 24 Harmonics. You can limit your harmonic being
edited to either ALL, ODD, EVEN, OCTAVES, or FIFTHS.

### Phaser

The **Phaser** effect is the psychedelic swooshing sound that became
popular in the 1960s and 70s and adds a sense of movement and swirling
to your sound. The effect filters your audio signal by creating a series
of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum and then modulated over
time

There are 2 STAGES for the effect. The controls for each STAGE are:

-   **SINE/NOISE** Sets modulation waveform

-   **RATE** Sets the speed of the sweep

-   **FEEDBACK** Sets the phaser resonance

-   **DEPTH** Sets the amount/richness of the effect

SETTINGS Tab

### Pitch Bend Range

The **PITCH BEND RANGE** sets the range that the **BEND** **WHEEL**
raises or lowers the pitch of your current Timbre. The default **Pitch
bend Depth** is 2 (two) semitones but can be increased or decreased,
from 0 (zero) semitones to ±25 (twenty five) semitones.

The **Pitch Bend** controller slider under the **MODS** tab in **Graphic
Screen Mode** can also reduce the overall range of individual Partials
in addition to **inverting** the pitch bend direction. This can give
each Partial pitch bend a different semitone range and varying pitch
directions.

![](//images/synclavier-v/image115.png){width="6.0in"
height="1.073611111111111in"}

### Timbre Normalize

The **TIMBRE NORMALIZE** button is located in the SYSTEM PARAMETER
Section under the **SETTINGS** Tab and adjusts the current Timbre to
avoid clipping as additional Partial Timbres are added to the Timbre.
When Timbre Normalize is ON, the volume of the Timbre is reduced if the
sum of the partials would produce a volume level greater than unity gain
(0.0 dB). You may wish to turn off **TIMBRE NORMALIZE** for certain
mixing applications.

System Parameter

### Noise Floor

The **NOISE FLOOR** knob is located in the SYSTEM PARAMETER Section
under the **SETTINGS** Tab and increases or decreases the steady state
noise floor even when there is no Timbre/Sound is being produced. This
steady state noise floor recreates the original Synclavier FM
synthesizer hardware. It adds a nice ambience to the sounds at the
default level of -90dB. The noise setting can be set to levels from OFF
to -20dB and is adjustable in 1dB increments.

For techies: The noise floor of Synclavier V is modeled as a filtered
pink-noise source with a very flat low level white-noise component. The
left and right outputs are modeled independently as well

### Animations

The **ANIMATIONS** button turns ON/OFF the animation effect while
switching between **Standard Panel Mode**, **Extended Panel Mode** and
**Graphic Screen Mode**. The default is setting is ON.

### Oversampling

**OVERSAMPLING** provides an additional level of interpolation between
the waveform samples exactly like an oversampling D/A converter.

The **OVERSAMPLING** knob is located in the SYSTEM PARAMETER Section
under the **SETTINGS** Tab and has range settings of 1X, 2X, 4X, 8X,
16X, 32X, and 64X oversampling. The default setting is 4X.

### Bit Depth

The **BIT DEPTH** knob is located in the SYSTEM PARAMETER Section under
the **SETTINGS** Tab and controls the numerical precision that is used
for the creation of digital audio. Small bit depths (such as 4 or 6
bits) produce an interesting distortion effect similar to a guitar
effects processor. The original Synclavier FM hardware had an internal
precision of 8 bits. Larger bit depths eliminate the quantization
distortion that is perceived in the smaller bits depths. The **BIT
DEPTH** setting ranges from 4 to 24 bits in 2 bit increments. The **BIT
DEPTH** is applied to all Timbres and Partial Timbres whose custom **BIT
DEPTH** setting in **Standard Panel Mode** is “**Default**”.

### Octave Ratio

Typically a modern day keyboard produces pitches in a 12 semitone
Western scale over a one octave range. The **OCTAVE RATIO** knob is
located in the SCALE ADJUSTMENT Section under the **SETTINGS** Tab and
controls the pitch spacing between keys of the keyboard.

-   An **OCTAVE RATIO** of 1.000 provides the default 12-tone Western
    scale tuning.

-   An **OCTAVE RATIO** of .500 provides quarter-tone steps for each
    half step on the keyboard. One octave on the keyboard now covers 1/2
    (one half) of an octave.

-   An **OCTAVE RATIO of** 2.000 provides whole-tone steps. One octave
    on the keyboard now cover two octaves.

-   An **OCTAVE RATIO** of 3.000 provides three semitones (or minor
    third steps) so each half step on the keyboard now plays a
    diminished scale. One octave on the keyboard now covers 3 (three)
    octaves.

-   An **OCTAVE RATIO** maximum of 4.000 provides 4 (four) semitones (or
    major third steps) so each half step on the keyboard now plays an
    augmented scale. One octave on the keyboard now covers 4 (four)
    octaves.

-   An **OCTAVE RATIO** minimum of 0.000 tunes each key to Middle
    A (A-440Hz).

Additional non-standard tunings are possible between whole number values
in .100 step increments.

Scale Adjustments

### Scale Tuning

The **SCALE TUNING** is located in the SCALE ADJUSTMENT Section under
the **SETTINGS** Tab. The **SCALE TUNING (FINE TUNE)** **knobs** (**C**,
**C\#**, **D**, **D\#**, **E**, **F**, **F\#**, **G**, **G\#**, **A**,
**A\#**, and **B**) adjust the pitch of each note of the 12-tone scale
independently, ±125 cents above and below the default tuning. To **FINE
TUNE** the pitch of a note, click on a **SCALE TUNING** knob and drag it
UP/DOWN to INCREASE/DECREASE the pitch. Double clicking on the knob
returns the function to its default value **0 CENTS**.

The **KEY TRANSPOSE** function raises or lowers any key of the scale in
single **semitone** steps. Click/drag up/down on any of the letters
below the knobs to raise/lower the pitch of that key. Double clicking on
the knob returns the function to its default pitch.
