The **Extended Panel Mode** can be viewed by clicking on the button
showing two downward pointing arrows at the top right of the
**Toolbar**. The controls are used to enter parameter settings for
individual Partials ANY number of **grouped** Partials. Clicking on this
button returns you to Standard Panel Mode.

Partial Select
--------------

The **PARTIAL SELECT** section is located at the top left of the
**Extended Panel Mode.** There are 12 Partial buttons, a **Solo**
button, a **Mute** button, a **Copy** button (with icon)**,** and a
**Paste** button (with icon).

### Partial Select \#1-12

At the top left of the **Extended Panel Mode** are the **PARTIAL SELECT
\#1-12 Red** buttons. While listening to any preset Timbre you will be
hearing the combined sound of anywhere from 1 to 12 Partial timbres
simultaneously.

To change any parameter setting for an individual Partial, click on that
**PARTIAL SELECT** button number. While that Partial button is on
(bright **Red**), any parameter you change on the **Extended Panel
Mode** will affect ONLY that Partial.

To make changes to 2 or more Partials at a time, hold down the
**&lt;shift&gt;** key and click any range of Partial buttons from \#1 to
12. For instance, if you want to select \#1 through \#6, hold down the
**&lt;shift&gt;** key and click on \#1 and \#6. If you’d rather just
select, only \#1, \#4, and \#6, hold down the **&lt;command&gt;** key
(**&lt;ctrl&gt;** key for Windows users) and then click on \#1, \#4 and
\#6. You will see the first **Red** button selected and the other
selected Partial buttons darkened out slightly.

### Copy & Paste

To **Copy** all of the parameters of one Partial to another, select the
Partial button number (\#1-12) you want to copy “**from**” and then
click once on the top **copy** **icon** button. This copies the
parameters to a clipboard. To then Paste those Partial parameters to
another Partial, select the Partial button number (\#1-12) you would
like to copy **“to”** and then click once on the bottom **paste**
**icon** button. You have now copied one Partial’s parameters to the
other.

### Solo

To **Solo** (isolate and listen to) an individual Partial, click on the
**S** button just to the right of the **copy icon** button. When you
play the keyboard, you will only be hearing the selected or **Solo**’d
Partial.

### Mute

To **Mute** (turn off) one of the Partials, click on the **M** button
just to the right of the **paste icon** button.

Partial Settings
----------------

The PARTIAL SETTINGS section is located at the left of the Extended
Panel Mode just below the PARTIAL SELECT section.

### Volume

The **Volume** knob is the overall loudness of the Partial or
**grouped** Partials selected. Its range is from 0.0db at full gain up
to -50.0db (OFF) in .1dB increments.

### Pan

The **Pan** knob globally moves the selected Partial or **grouped**
Partials stereo positioning left/right. Setting the knob straight up is
**center**. The range is from -63 (hard left) to +63 (hard right). After
turning the knob left or right you can return to **center** position by
double-clicking on the knob.

### Pitch Track

The **Pitch Track** button On/Off determines if the selected Partial or
**grouped** Partials track the **Virtual Keyboard** or external MIDI
keyboard/controller. When turned OFF, the pitch will be constant (A-440
Note MIDI note \#69) with any note depressed.

### Octave

The **Octave** knob controls the octave placement of the A-440 Hz (MIDI
key \#69) of the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials. It can be set
to 1 of 9 discrete values from 6.875 Hz. to 1760 Hz. Double clicking
will return it to the default value of 440.0 Hz.

Tip: Values in the extreme low range can be useful for unusual sound
effects. Select the Preset “Syn Harpsi”(a 1-Partial Timbre), lower the
Octave button to 13.75 Hz and play notes in the lowest octave on the
**Virtual Keyboard**. At the default 8-bit **Bit Depth** setting you
will hear digital aliasing noise added to the original Timbre/Sound.

### Transpose

The **Transpose** knob sets the pitch of the selected Partial or
**grouped** Partials up or down in **semitone** increments. At the
knob’s center position there is **No Transposition**. You can view the
semitone value in the **Lower Toolbar** at the lower left side while you
are turning the knob or placing your cursor over the knob. Double
clicking the knob returns the knob to center or **No Transposition**.
The range is from -24 to +24 semitones.

### Tuning

The **Tuning** knob fine tunes the pitch of selected Partial or
**grouped** Partials up or down in individual **Cents** (100ths of a
semitone). At the knob’s center position there is no pitch change. The
parameter value is displayed in Cents in the **Lower Toolbar** at the
lower left. Double clicking the knob returns the knob to center or
**0.00** Cents. The range is from -125 to +125 Cents below and above the
setting of the **Transpose** knob.

### Voice Chorus

The **Voice Chorus** knob creates a duplicate voice of the selected
Partial or **grouped** Partials with a different pitch of your Partial
or Partials. At the knob’s center position there is no added voice, a
value of 1.000. You can view the Chorus value in the **Lower Toolbar**
at the lower left side while you are turning the knob or by placing your
cursor over the knob. The range is from 0.000 to 16.000 in steps of
.100. Double clicking on the knob returns the value to 1.000 or NO
**Voice Chorus**.

**Chorus:** Relationship of added voice

**Setting:** to fundamental frequency

**0.500:** One octave below

**1.000:** Unison (no added Voice Chorus)

**1.500:** Perfect fifth above

**2.000:** Second harmonic (one octave above)

**3.000:** Third harmonic (one octave plus a perfect fifth above)

**4.000:** Fourth harmonic (two octaves above)

**5.000:** Fifth harmonic (two octaves plus a major third above)

**6.000:** Sixth harmonic (two octaves plus a perfect fifth above)

**7.000:** Seventh harmonic (two octaves plus a minor seventh above)

**8.000:** Eighth harmonic (three octaves above)

**9.000:** Ninth harmonic (three octaves plus a major second above)

**10.000:** Tenth harmonic (three octaves plus a major third above)

**11.000:** Eleventh harmonic (three octaves plus an augmented fourth
above)

**12.000:** Twelfth harmonic (three octaves plus a perfect fifth above)

**13.000:** Thirteenth harmonic (three octaves plus a perfect sixth
above)

**14.000:** Fourteenth harmonic (three octaves plus a minor seventh
above)

**15.000:** Fifteenth harmonic (three octaves plus a major seventh
above)

**16.000:** Sixteenth harmonic (four octaves above)

### Chorus Fine

The **Chorus Fine** knob is a much smaller tuning adjustment of the
**Voice Chorus** for the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials. Range
is from -.100 to +.100 in increments of .100. These values read out in
the **Lower Toolbar** left side as well. Double clicking on the knob
returns it to its center position 0.000.

### F.M. Ratio

The **F.M. Ratio** knob controls the ratio of the F.M. Modulator
frequency to the F.M. Carrier frequency for the selected Partial or
**grouped** Partials. There must be a **CARRIER** wave AND a
**MODULATOR** wave assigned to a Partial on the **Time Slices** page in
**Graphic Screen Mode** for this control to have any effect on the
Partial. The Range is from 0.000 to 16.000 in increments of .100.

###  F.M. Fine

The **F.M. Fine** knob is a much smaller adjustment to the **F.M.
Ratio** (ratio of the F.M. Modulator frequency to the F.M. Carrier
frequency) for the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials. There must
be a **CARRIER** wave AND a **MODULATOR** wave assigned to a Partial on
the **Time Slices** page in **Graphic Screen Mode** for this control to
have any effect on the Partial. The Range is from -0.100 to +0.100 in
very small increments of .001.

### F.M. Amount

The **F.M. Amount** knob controls the overall amount of F.M. modulation
for the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials. There must be a
**CARRIER** wave AND a **MODULATOR** wave assigned to a Partial on the
**Time Slices** page in **Graphic Screen Mode** for this control to have
any effect on the timbre. The Range is from 0.000 to 1.000.

### Frame Speed

The **Frame Speed** knob increases or decreases the overall time that
**Timbre Slice** Frames crossfade into one another for the selected
Partial or **grouped** Partials. Parameter range is from 0.00 to 2.50 in
increments of .01. The default value is 1.00 which is the original
**Frame Speed** of the **Timbre Slice** Timbre.

Amplitude Envelope
------------------

The **AMPLITUDE ENVELOPE** section is located at the top center section
of the **Extended Panel Mode**. It controls the volume shape of the
selected Partial or **grouped** Partials from the first note-on event.

A simple comparison would be the Volume Envelope ADSR in an Analog
subtractive synthesizer.

### Delay

The **Delay** knob increases the time for the selected Partial or
**grouped** Partials to be heard after the initial note-on (key
depression)**.** The default value is 0 MSec (milliseconds) and the
range is 0 MSec to 30.0 Secs (seconds) in 1 millisecond increments.

### Attack

The **Attack** knob adjusts how fast or slow the Timbre/Sound ramps UP
in volume from the note-on (key depression) to the **Peak** setting for
the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials. The default is a value of
3 MSecs (milliseconds) and the range is 0 MSec to 30 Secs (seconds).

The actual **Attack** “time” will vary depending on the **Peak** level.
At the maximum **Peak** level of 100.0, the **Attack** time will be as
read. As the **Peak** level is reduced, the **Attack** “time” will
decrease, as it takes less time to reach the lower **Peak** level.

### Peak

The **Peak** knob adjusts the next volume level point in the
Timbre/Sound after the initial **Attack** of the selected Partial or
**grouped** Partials. The level ranges from 0.00 to 100.0.

### Decay

The **Decay** knob adjusts how fast or slow the Timbre/Sound ramps DOWN
in volume from the **Peak** setting to the **Sustain** level setting of
the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials. The default is a value of
3 MSecs (milliseconds) and the time range is from 0 MSec to 30 Secs
(seconds).

The actual **Decay** “time” will vary depending on the **Sustain**
level. At the minimum **Sustain** level of 0.0, the **Decay** time will
be as read. As the **Sustain** level is increased, the **Decay** “time”
will decrease, as it takes less time to reach the lower **Sustain**
level.

### Sustain

The **Sustain** knob adjusts sound volume level after the **Decay**
portion of the envelope. The level ranges from 0.00 to 100.0.

### Release

The **Release** knob adjusts the final decay time after the note-off
(key release) for the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials. The time
range is from 0 MSec (milliseconds) to 30 Secs (seconds).

Harmonic Envelope
-----------------

The **HARMONIC ENVELOPE** section is located at the top right section of
the **Extended Panel Mode**. It controls the **F.M.** (Frequency
Modulator) volume shape of the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials
from the first note-on (key depression).

A simple comparison would be the Filter Envelope ADSR in an Analog
subtractive synthesizer.

### Delay

The **Delay** knob increases the time for the selected Partial or
**grouped** Partials’ **F.M**. (Frequency Modulator) to be heard after
the initial note-on (key depression)**.** Any **AMPLITUDE Delay** value
will add to the total **Delay** time for the **F.M**. to be heard after
the initial note-on. The default delay value is 0 MSec (milliseconds)
and the range is 0 MSec to 30.0 Secs (seconds) in 1 millisecond
increments.

### Attack

The **Attack** knob adjusts how fast or slow the **F.M.** (Frequency
Modulator) ramps UP in volume of the selected Partial or **grouped**
Partials from the note-on (key depression) to the **Peak** setting. The
default is a value of 3 MSecs (milliseconds) and the range is 0 MSec to
30 Secs (seconds).

### Peak

The **Peak** knob adjusts the next level point in the **F.M.**
(Frequency Modulator) after the initial **Attack** of the selected
Partial or **grouped** Partials. The level ranges from 0.00 to 100.0.

### Decay

The **Decay** knob adjusts how fast or slow the **F.M.** (Frequency
Modulator) ramps DOWN in volume from the **Peak** setting to the
**Sustain** level setting of the selected Partial or **grouped**
Partials. The default is a value of 3 MSecs (milliseconds) and the time
range is from 0 MSec to 30 Secs (seconds).

### Sustain

The **Sustain** knob adjusts **F.M.** (Frequency Modulator) level of the
selected Partial or **grouped** Partials after the **Decay** portion of
the envelope. The level ranges from 0.00 to 100.0.

### Release

The **Release** knob adjusts the final decay time of the **F.M.**
(Frequency Modulator) after the note-off (key release) for the selected
Partial or **grouped** Partials. The time range is from 0 MSec
(milliseconds) to 30 Secs (seconds).

Vibrato
-------

The **VIBRATO** section is located at the middle/center section of the
**Extended Panel Mode**. It provides a wide range of vibrato effects
similar to the LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) of an Analog synthesizer
which modulates the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials. The pitch
fluctuates equally above and below the pitch of the key played.

A sine wave vibrato of 5.00 to 6.00 Herz is typically used to create the
style of vibrato associated with vocalists, and traditional string and
wind instruments. The other digital waveshapes are particularly useful
for other musical and special effects.

### Wave

**Wave** is a drop-down menu to select the Shape of waveform modulator
controlling the Vibrato effects. Choose from **Sine**, **Triangle**,
**Ramp** (Sawtooth), **Inverted Ramp**, **Square**, and **Random**
waves.

![](/images/synclavier-v/image69.png){width="3.832959317585302in"
height="3.072165354330709in"}

### Sync

When using Synclavier V as an instrument plug-in in your DAW project,
the **Sync** button allows the **Vibrato** functions to synchronize with
the tempo of your DAW project. The tempo is set by the **Rate** knob.

### Rate

The **Rate** knob determines the speed of your **Vibrato**. When the
**Sync** button is OFF the **Rate** value reads in Hz (Hertz or cycles
per second) in the **Lower Toolbar**. The range is 0.00Hz to 50.0Hz.
Double clicking on the knob returns the rate to the default value of
5.00Hz. When the **Sync** button is ON the **Rate** value reads as
Vibrato BPM Multiplier also in the **Lower Toolbar.**

### Carrier

The **Carrier** knob controls the Depth of the **Vibrato.** The pitch
fluctuates equally above and below the pitch of the key played. The
range is 0 semitones to 25 semitones.

### Link

The **Link** button allows the **Modulator** (F.M.) to be simultaneously
affected by the Vibrato **Carrier** (depth of the Vibrato effect). When
the **Link** button is ON you will notice the **Modulator** knob will
match the position of the **Carrier** knob as you turn it. With the Link
button OFF, you can get quite different vibrato effects but adjusting
the knobs independently.

### Modulator

The **Modulator** knob controls the amount of F.M. modulation (Harmonic
variation) or Depth affected by the Vibrato **Carrier**. The range is 0
semitones to 25 semitones. When the **Link** button is ON, the
**Modulator** (depth) is connected to the Carrier (depth).

### Attack

The **Attack** knob adjusts the amount of delay before the **Vibrato**
effect begins after the note-on. The range is 0 MSecs to 30 seconds.

### Bias

Normally when vibrato is added to a Partial Timbre, the pitch of each
note fluctuates an equal amount above and below the pitch of the key
played. When the **Bias** button is turned ON, the lowest point of pitch
fluctuation is the pitch of the note played. The highest point is twice
the number of semitones set for the vibrato **Depth**.

### S-Curve

When the **S-Curve** button is OFF and **Vibrato** begins, the attack
ramps in a straight line (Linear) to the carrier and modulator depths.
When the **S-curve** button is turned ON, there is a more gently start
to the **Vibrato** attack.

### Quantize

The **Quantize** button steps the **Vibrato** curve to the nearest
semitone. This feature is only useful with large Vibrato depths greater
than 1.00 semitone. This quantization function observes the current
scale tuning parameters.

(See Section 7.8.6 Timbre Octave Ratio and 7.8.7 Tuning (Scale))

### Invert

The **Invert** button changes the direction that the **Vibrato** wave
starts. When the button is OFF, the pitch rises first, above the
original pitch. When the button is ON, the pitch falls first, below the
original pitch.

Stereo
------

The **STEREO** section is located at the middle/center section of the
**Extended Panel Mode** just below the **Vibrato** section. These
controls offer a wide variety of Left and Right placement (Panning) in
the sound field as well as animated motion between Left and Right
positions of the selected Partial or **grouped** Partials.

Tremolo (Amplitude Modulation) effects are also available when the
periodic modulator wave is “in phase” by setting the **Phase** control
to 0° or 360°. When the **Phase** control is set to 0° or 360° the
Left/Right position is not affected.

### Wave

**Wave** is a drop-down menu to select the shape of waveform modulator
controlling the **Stereo** and Tremolo effects. Choose from **Sine**,
**Triangle** and **Square** waves.

### Sync

When using Synclavier V as an instrument plug-in in your DAW project,
the **Sync** button allows the **Stereo** functions to synchronize with
the tempo of your DAW project. The tempo is set by the **Rate** knob.

### Rate

The **Rate** knob determines the speed of your **Stereo** panning
effects and Tremolo non-panning effects. When the **Sync** button is OFF
the **Rate** value reads in Hz (Hertz or cycles per second) in the
**Lower Toolbar**. The range is 0.00Hz to 50.0Hz. Double clicking on the
knob returns the rate to the default value of 5.00Hz. When the **Sync**
button is ON the **Rate** value reads as Tremolo BPM Multiplier also in
the **Lower Toolbar. **

### Depth

The **Depth** knob controls the width of the **Stereo** panning effects
or the depth of the Tremelo effects. The range is 0.0% to 100% and
displays at the left side of the **Lower Toolbar**.

### Attack

The **Attack** knob adjusts the amount of delay before the **Stereo**
effect begins after the note-on. The range is 0 MSecs to 30 seconds and
displayed at the left side of the **Lower Toolbar**

### Phase

The **Phase** knob defaults to 180° which allow full Left/Right Stereo
panning effects. Turning the knob full down to 0° or full up to 360°
will allow Tremolo (Amplitude Modulation) effects with NO Left/Right
Stereo panning. Other settings between 0° and 360° will display varying
degrees of Left/Right panning depth.

### S-Curve

When the **S-Curve** button is OFF and **Stereo** modulation effects
begins, the attack ramps in a straight line (Linear) to the carrier and
modulator depths. When the **S-curve** button is turned ON, there is a
more gently start to the **Stereo** attack.

### Alternate

The **Alternate** button turns on a function that alternates the
starting Left/Right side of a Left/Right Pan for every new MIDI note-on
event. The **Depth** control sets the range of the Left/Right Pan for
the **Alternate** effect.

### Invert

The **Invert** button changes the direction that the **Wave** starts.
When the button is OFF, the stereo position moves to the LEFT first,
from the original stereo position. When the button is ON, the stereo
position moves to the RIGHT first, from the original stereo position. If
the **Alternate** button is ON, the Left/Right position of the sound is
switched.

This function is useful to vary the Left/Right position of multiple
Partials occurring at the same note-on event.
