# Introduction

Congratulations on purchasing Synclavier V! We are confident that it
will give you many hours of synthesizing and playing unique sounds (or
as we prefer to call them on the Synclavier V, Timbres).

Synclavier V is the newest addition to our extensive family of
instruments that recreate hard-to-find synthesizers and classic
keyboards.

## What is Synclavier V?

The Synclavier V is a software recreation of the Synclavier Digital
Synthesizer, combining Additive, FM (Frequency Modulation) and Timbre
Frame synthesis. In addition to bringing the authentic and instantly
recognizable timbres of the Synclavier to your studio or stage, we have
expanded some of the features and added some 21st century features not
available in the original Synclavier!

Developed by the original Synclavier software designer Cameron Jones,
the DSP engine of Synclavier V authentically reproduces the sound of the
FM 8-bit voice cards of the Synclavier right down to the noise floor! It
runs both as a stand-alone instrument on Windows and Mac OS X and as a
plug-in in all major formats inside your DAW (Digital Audio
Workstation). It has easy MIDI learn functionality for hands-on control
of many of its parameters and in plug-in mode supports automation for
greater creative control.

## History of the Original Instrument

The original Synclavier® (pronounced “sin-cla-veer” by its creators), is
a digital music synthesizer workstation. The brain is an ABLE 16-bit
minicomputer processor controlling 8-bit additive, FM (frequency
modulation), and Timbre Frame synthesizer voices. The computer is
connected to a separate organ type on/off 5-octave keyboard for live
performance and recording into a 16-track “Memory Recorder” (a.k.a.
sequencer).

A “**Green** screen” monitor was also used to enter and edit sounds,
music events and computer files, all stored on 5.25” floppy disks and
later, hard disk drives.

Creation of the Synclavier I began in 1972 at Dartmouth College in
Hanover, New Hampshire, U.S.A. by Music Professor Jon Appleton and
Thayer School of Engineering Professor Frederick J. Hooven. Sydney A.
Alonso was a research associate at the engineering school and was
assigned to the project in 1972 along with student programmer Cameron
Jones.

In 1976 Alonso and Jones formed a new company, New England Digital
Corporation (N.E.D.) in Norwich, Vermont U.S.A., producing and selling
their first product, the ABLE computer but they had no capital. In 1978
they were approached by Burbank & Company investment advisors. That
finally yielded a substantial capital investment with the focus of
expanding the computer division.

Brad Naples, a Berklee College of Music graduate with a degree in music
composition, was living in Boston and saw a Channel 4 TV spot on Jon
Appleton with the Synclavier, immediately saw the potential, and came
knocking on N.E.D.’s door. He was soon hired as business manager and
would later take the Synclavier II to the Audio Engineering Society
(AES) convention. Being the first time anyone other than Alonso or Jones
had sold anything for the company, Brad Naples was promoted to Sales
Manager and in 1982 became President.

Synthesist, sound designer, and composer Denny Jaeger convinced Alonso
of the commercial potential for the musical instrument and with his
major design contributions, development of the Synclavier II began.

Other features later added were monophonic **Sample-to-Disk** with
16-bit 50khz sampling rate, many software updates including
**Resynthesis**, a method of converting a sampled sound into Timbre
Frames of additive synthesis sound. These Timbre Frames were chained
together, similar to film frames, and could be edited. The **Music
Printing Option** was one of the first and most advanced print music
editors allowing note entry from the Memory Recorder or direct monitor
screen entry and printing to either a dot-matrix printer, laser printer,
or output to a digital typesetting format.

N.E.D. introduced the Digital Guitar option to give guitarists a way to
perform with the Synclavier sounds and Memory Recorder (sequencer). The
interface consisted of the Roland G-303 guitar, a custom controller that
attached to the guitar, and a rack mount interface. Jazz guitarists Pat
Metheny and John McLaughlin were early adopters.

A larger 6-octave velocity-and-pressure-sensitive keyboard, referred to
as the “VPK”, was introduced in 1984 with a 32-track Memory Recorder,
pitch bend and modulation wheels, and many more assignable buttons.

Velocity/Pressure Sensitive Keyboard (VPK)

In 1984 N.E.D. raised more capital and was able to develop the
Polyphonic Sampling system, one of the largest hardware and software
updates. The user could now playback multiple sampled sounds
simultaneously directly from RAM (Random Access Memory) rather than a
hard disk drive. The 2-foot tall rack grew into a mega tower named the
PSMT (Polyphonic Sampling Memory Tower). A fully loaded system would
have 32 sampling voices, 32 FM synthesizer voices, 32 megabytes of RAM,
32 multichannel outputs, Stereo 100khz sampling, MIDI 8 in/8 out module,
SMPTE reader/generator interface card, Clock module, 2 320mb hard
drives, and a 5-1/4” 1.4mb floppy disk drive (needed to install software
and boot up the whole system).

The Direct-to-Disk “option”, available in 4, 8 or 16 tracks, introduced
100khz recording to hard disk and connected to the Synclavier tower.

The later models included a 9600 which offered up to 96 sampling voices,
32 FM synthesizer voices, and 96 megabytes of RAM and 16 multichannel
outputs.

-   3200 - 32 sampling voices, 32mb RAM

-   6400 - 64 sampling voices, 64mb RAM

-   9600TS Tapeless Studio (9600 plus Direct-to Disk)

-   PostPro - A stand-alone Direct-to-Disk

The Partial Timbre Method of Sound Design
-----------------------------------------

**The Partial Timbre Method of Sound Design** was first described in US
Patent [4,554,855](http://synclavier.com/PDF%20Files/4554855.pdf). The
intent of the Partial Timbre Method is to be able to design new complex
musical sounds by easily creating and modifying acoustically
identifiable subcomponents of the sound. The original Synclavier Digital
Synthesizer used a custom button panel that gave the operator control
over the soloing and design of each component when a note was performed;
each subcomponent was referred to as a “**Partial Timbre**”.

This Synclavier V instrument implementation expands the number of
**Partial Timbres** to 12, from the original total of 4 Partial Timbres.

Each Partial of Synclavier V has a 24-harmonic **carrier** waveform with
phase control for each harmonic. These harmonics in any combination,
create a waveform that can be played and also viewed graphically. In
addition, there is a 24-harmonic **modulator** waveform, FM (frequency
modulation), which can modulate this **carrier** waveform. The FM
modulator waveform can be a single sinusoidal (sine) wave, sawtooth
wave, square wave, triangle wave, or any 24 harmonic waveform of your
own design.

Now, imagine chaining up to 50 of these waveforms together to form a
constantly evolving timbre. These **Timbre Slices** (the original
Synclavier called them Timbre Frames) can have varying time lengths,
crossfade times, and pitch and volumes. Just think about the infinite
possibilities of 12 different continuously varying waveforms sounding at
the same time! Add in some stereo placement and you’ll have a huge
soundscape.

What does Synclavier V add to the original?
-------------------------------------------

-   Control of Bit Depth from 4-bit to 24-bit resolution (the original
    are 8-bit synthesizers)

-   What could be better than the original Synclavier’s 4 **Partial
    Timbres**? More Partial Timbres of course! Synclavier V has a total
    of 12 **Partial Timbres**.

-   Sawtooth, Square and Triangle FM modulator waveforms in addition to
    the origin![](/images/synclavier-v/image19.tif){width="5.225092957130359in"
    height="1.3611111111111112in"}al single Sine wave. Plus, you can
    build your own modulator waveform using 24 harmonics including phase
    control

-   Graphical Waveform Screen of each Partial and FM modulator

-   **Timbre Slices** (Timbre Frames) can each be assigned a separate FM
    modulator waveform

-   Added Effects

    -   Flanger

    -   Delay

    -   Chorus
