Standard Panel Mode Controls
============================

Timbre Settings
---------------

All of the TIMBRE SETTINGS controls are **global** and affect all of the
Partials, but relative to the Partials’ individual settings. For
example, if a the PAN in PARTIAL SETTINGS is panned far right for one
Partial, it will only have a range of far right to center when setting
the PAN in the TIMBRE SETTINGS section full left.

Timbre Settings

### Volume 

The **Volume** knob is the overall loudness of the Timbre/Sound
affecting all Partials. Its range is from 0.0db at full gain up to -50db
(OFF) in increments of .1dB.

### Pan

The **Pan** knob globally moves the Partials stereo positioning
left/right. Setting the knob straight up is **center**. The range is
from -63 (hard left) to +63 (hard right). After turning the knob left or
right you can return to **center** position by double-clicking on the
knob.

### Transpose

The **Transpose** knob sets the pitch of your overall Timbre/Sound up or
down in **semitone** increments. At the knob’s center position there is
**No Transposition**. You can view the semitone value in the **Lower
Toolbar** at the lower left side while you are turning the knob or
placing your cursor over the knob. Double clicking the knob returns the
knob to center or **No Transposition**. The range is from -24 to +24
semitones.

### Tuning

The **Tuning** knob fine tunes the pitch of your overall Timbre/Sound up
or down in individual **Cents** (100ths of a semitone). At the knob’s
center position there is no pitch change. The parameter value is
displayed in **Cents** in the **Lower Toolbar** at the lower left. The
range is from -125 to +125 Cents below and above the setting of the
**Transpose** knob.

### Voice Chorus

The **Voice Chorus** creates a duplicate voice of all of the Partials
with a different pitch of your overall Timbre/Sound. At the knob’s
center position there is no added voice, a value of 1.000. You can view
the Chorus value in the **Lower Toolbar** at the lower left side while
you are turning the knob or by placing your cursor over the knob. The
range is from 0.000 to 16.000 in steps of .100. Double clicking on the
knob returns the value to 1.000 or NO **Voice Chorus**.

**Chorus:** Relationship of added voice

**Setting:** to fundamental frequency

**0.500:** One octave below

**1.000:** Unison (no added Voice Chorus)

**1.500:** Perfect fifth above

**2.000:** Second harmonic (one octave above)

**3.000:** Third harmonic (one octave plus a perfect fifth above)

**4.000:** Fourth harmonic (two octaves above)

**5.000:** Fifth harmonic (two octaves plus a major third above)

**6.000:** Sixth harmonic (two octaves plus a perfect fifth above)

**7.000:** Seventh harmonic (two octaves plus a minor seventh above)

**8.000:** Eighth harmonic (three octaves above)

**9.000:** Ninth harmonic (three octaves plus a major second above)

**10.000:** Tenth harmonic (three octaves plus a major third above)

**11.000:** Eleventh harmonic (three octaves plus an augmented fourth
above)

**12.000:** Twelfth harmonic (three octaves plus a perfect fifth above)

**13.000:** Thirteenth harmonic (three octaves plus a perfect sixth
above)

**14.000:** Fourteenth harmonic (three octaves plus a minor seventh
above)

**15.000:** Fifteenth harmonic (three octaves plus a major seventh
above)

**16.000:** Sixteenth harmonic (four octaves above)

### Chorus Fine

The **Chorus Fine** knob is a much smaller tuning adjustment of the
**Voice Chorus**. Range is from -.100 to +.100 and are between the
**Voice Chorus** steps of .100. These values read out in the **Lower
Toolbar** left side as well.

Double clicking on the knob returns it to its center position 0.000.

### F.M. Modulation

The **F.M. Modulation** knob controls the overall amount of F.M.
modulation for all the Partials in the current Timbre. The parameter
range is from 0.000 to 1.000.

**Important:** For this control to have ANY effect on the Timbre:

-   There must be a **CARRIER** wave AND a **MODULATOR** wave assigned
    to one or more Partials under the **TIME SLICES** Tab (**Graphic
    Screen Mode**).

-   The **F.M. Amount** control in **Partial Settings** (**Extended
    Panel Mode**) must be greater than

-   0.000

-   The Modulation value in SLICE SETTINGS for one or more Partials
    under the **TIME SLICES** Tab (**Graphic Screen Mode**) must be
    greater than 0.00

### Bit Depth

**Bit Depth** controls the digital resolution of the current timbre. The
original Synclavier voices were 8-bit but Synclavier V has added a range
from 4-bit all the way up to 24-bit resolution in increments of 2. On
the lower end, you will hear a digital noise or aliasing causing a
grittiness to the sound. As you increase the **Bit** **Depth** knob, the
sound will sound “smoother” with no noise.

Amp Env Offset
--------------

All of the **AMP ENV OFFSET** controls are **global** and affect all of
the Partials in the current Timbre, but relative to the Partials’
individual settings. For example, if one Partial \#1 has a slow attack
and Partial \#2 has a fast attack, decreasing the value will only affect
the attack of Partial \#1.

height="2.240972222222222in"}

### Attack

The **Attack** knob increases or decreases volume envelope ramp up time
of all Partials in the current Timbre. The volume envelope, or how fast
the sound ramps up in volume from the note-on, is affected. The default
is a value of 0.00 and the range is -1.00 to +1.00.

(See also section **6.3.2** **Attack** of an individual Partial)

### Decay

The **Decay** knob increases or decreases values of all Partials’ Decay
in the current Timbre.

-   When the Peak level is greater than 0.00, **Decay** controls how
    fast the sound ramps down from the **Peak** volume to the
    Sustain volume.

-   When the Peak level is 0.00, **Decay** controls how fast the sound
    ramps up to the Sustain volume.

-   The default is a value of 0.00 and the range is -1.00 to +1.00.

(See also section **6.3.4** **Decay** of an individual Partial)

### Release

The **Release** knob increases or decreases values of all Partials’
Release in the current Timbre. Release is the time for the sound to
decay to zero after the key on the keyboard is let go.

(See also section **6.3.6 Release** of an individual Partial)

Harm Env Offset
---------------

All of the **HARM ENV OFFSET** controls are **global** and affect all of
the Partials in the current Timbre, but relative to the Partials’
individual settings. For example, if one Partial \#1 has a slow harmonic
(F.M.) attack and Partial \#2 has a fast harmonic (F.M.) attack,
decreasing the value will only affect the attack of Partial \#1.

### Attack

The **Attack** knob increases or decreases values of all the Partials’
harmonic (F.M.) envelope in the current Timbre. The harmonic (F.M.)
envelope, or how fast the F.M. amount ramps up in volume from the
beginning, is affected. The default is a value of 0.00 and the range is
-1.00 to +1.00.

(See also section **6.3.2** harmonic **Attack** of an individual
Partial).

### Decay

The **Decay** knob increases or decreases values of all the Partials’
harmonic Decay of the current Timbre.

-   When the Peak level is greater than 0.00, **Decay** controls how
    fast the harmonic envelope ramps down from the **Peak** volume to
    the harmonic Sustain level.

-   When the Peak level is 0.00, **Decay** controls how fast the
    harmonic envelope ramps up to the harmonic Sustain level.

-   The default is a value of 0.00 and the range is -1.00 to +1.00.

(See also section **6.4.4** harmonic **Decay** of an individual Partial)

### Release

The **Release** knob increases or decreases values of all the Partials’
harmonic (F.M.) Release in the current Timbre. Release is the time for
the sound to decay to zero after the key on the keyboard is let go.

(See also section **6.4.6** harmonic **Release** of an individual
Partial)

Repeat/Arpeggio
--------------------

The **REPEAT/ARPEGGIO** section of Synclavier V is a **global** control
affecting all of the Partials in your current Timbre.

###  5.4.1 Repeat

When the **Repeat** button is turned on, all of the notes being played
on your keyboard will repeat while a key is being depressed. When
multiple keys are depressed, any delay between notes will remain. The
repeat rate will be determined by the **Rate** knob.

###  5.4.2 Arpeggio

When the **Arpeggio** button is turned on, any notes simultaneously
performed on your keyboard will sound independently in an arpeggio
pattern. If the **Repeat** button is also turned on, the selected notes
held down will continue to arpeggiate at the tempo set by the **Rate**
knob.

### Sync

When using Synclavier V as an instrument plug-in in your DAW project,
the **Sync** button allows both the **Repeat** and **Arpeggio**
functions to synchronize with the tempo of your DAW project. The tempo
is set by the **Rate** knob.

### Rate

The **Rate** knob determines the speed of your repeating notes or
arpeggios. When the **Sync** button is OFF the **Rate** value reads in
Hz (Hertz or cycles per second) in the **Lower Toolbar**. The range is
0.00 to 50.0Hz.

When the **Sync** button is ON the **Rate** value reads as Timbre BPM
Multiplier in the **Lower Toolbar.**

When Synclavier V is used as an instrument plug-in in your DAW project
and the **Sync** button is turned ON, the speed will synchronize to the
tempo of your DAW project. The **Rate** adjustment is a BPM Multiplier
(Beats Per Minute). Values are:

**BPM/8:** 1/8 speed of your tempo

**BPM/6:** 1/6 speed of your tempo

**BPM/5:** 1/8 speed of your tempo

**BPM/4:** 1/4 speed of your tempo

**BPM/3:** 1/3 speed of your tempo

**BPM/2:** 1/2 speed of your tempo

**BPMx1:** Exact speed of your tempo

**BPMx2:** 2x speed of your tempo

**BPMx3:** 3x speed of your tempo

**BPMx4:** 4x speed of your tempo

**BPMx5:** 5x speed of your tempo

**BPMx6:** 6x speed of your tempo

**BPMx8:** 8x speed of your tempo

### Pattern

**Pattern** is a drop-down menu with 6 different arpeggio styles

(top to bottom order):

-   Performance order: the notes will play in the order in which you
    perform them on the keyboard **RATE** Sets the speed of the sweep

-   Keyboard Up: Notes play from the lowest to the highest continuously

-   Keyboard Down: Notes play from the highest to the lowest
    continuously

-   Keyboard Up/Down (Repeat): Notes play up, down and repeat the top
    and bottom notes

-   Keyboard Up/Down (No Repeat): Notes play up, down without repeating
    the top and bottom notes

-   Random: Notes play in a continuously random pattern

Polyphonic Mode
---------------

The **POLYPHONIC MODE** section contains **global** functions that
affect all Partials in the current Timbre.

![](/images/synclavier-v/image62.png){width="3.0625in" height="2.83125in"}

### Poly Normal

The **Poly Normal** mode provides for full polyphony. When a Note On
event is received (either keyboard or sequencer) a new voice is
activated for the desired sound in all cases. Earlier notes of the same
pitch that are in the Final **Decay** state are not affected; their
decay continues without interruption. With very long final decay
settings this can lead to undesirable phase cancellations or overloading
the audio output.

### Poly Retrig.

**Poly Retrig.** mode allows for full polyphony, however if a Note On
event is received that matches a note that is currently in the Final
**Decay** state, the envelope generators for the matching note are
retriggered. The **Poly Retrig.** mode is very natural for sounds with a
long final decay such as bells or gongs. **Polyphonic Retrig.** is the
default polyphony mode.

### Mono Porta

**Mono Porta** mode restricts the audio output to one note of the
current Timbre at a time. The effect is a legato phrase similar to the
tonguing and slurring technique of a wind or brass instrument. The
monophonic settings are also useful for recreating the sounds of early
analog and digital synthesizers that were monophonic by design.

In this mode, when a new note is played while an earlier note is being
held, the previous note ends and the result is a “slur” to the new note.
The envelope generators are NOT retriggered. Synthesists refer to this
as “Single Triggering”.

### Mono Retrig.

**Mono Retrig.** mode also restricts the audio output to one note of the
current Timbre at a time. When a new note is received while an earlier
note is being held, the pitch of the earlier note is adjusted to match
the new note and the envelope generators ARE retriggered. The effect is
a more percussive sound from every note. Synthesists refer to this as
“Multi-Triggering”.

Portamento
----------

**PORTAMENTO** is a global parameter affecting all Partials in the
current Timbre. It makes the pitch “glide” between the notes you play,
rather than changing the pitch instantly as soon as you hit another key
or keys on your keyboard. The effect works on Polyphonic or Monophonic
Timbres.

### On

The **On** button turns the **PORTAMENTO** function ON or OFF.

### Log/Lin

**Log/Line** button switches between a Linear or a Logarithmic curve for
the **PORTAMENTO** “glide” effect. OFF is Linear and ON is Logarithmic.

### Rate

**Rate** knob controls the speed at which the sound glides from one
pitch to the next. The range is from 0.0 milliseconds to 30 seconds.

Bend Wheel & Mod Wheel
----------------------

The **BEND** **WHEEL** & **MOD** **WHEEL** are located on the left hand
side of the Virtual Keyboard and can also be controlled from a MIDI
keyboard or other MIDI controller.

The **BEND** **WHEEL** raises or lowers the pitch of your current Timbre
up or down gradually. The default **Pitch bend Depth** is 2 (two)
semitones but can be increased or decreased, from 0 (zero) semitones to
25 (twenty five) semitones, under the **SETTINGS** tab of the **Graphic
Screen Mode. **

The **BEND WHEEL** is “spring loaded” and comes to rest in the center
position. It can also be routed to control other Partial parameters in
the **MODS** section of the **Graphic Screen Mode**. See section
**7.5.1** for further details on routing.

The **MOD WHEEL** can also be routed to many Partial parameters. Not
“spring loaded” like the **BEND** **WHEEL,** it operates like a slider
down and up. Its range is from 0.000 to 1.000. A common routing is to
control vibrato depth.
