User Interface
==============

Synclavier V has many great features, and in this chapter we’ll make
sure you know what each one does. You will be amazed at how quickly
Synclavier V provides you with sounds that are inspiring and perfect for
all sorts of projects.

It’s also really easy to work with: just a few tweaks here and there and
suddenly you’re in a new world of sound. That will always be the main
focus of every Arturia product: unleashing your creativity while
remaining easy to use.

The Virtual Keyboard
--------------------

![](images/image24.png){width="5.988888888888889in"
height="2.218391294838145in"}

The **Virtual Keyboard** allows you to play a sound without the need for
an external MIDI device. Simply click on a virtual key to hear the
currently selected timbre. You can also drag the cursor across the keys
to hear a glissando.

The Synclavier V can be velocity sensitive from an external MIDI
keyboard or other MIDI device but the sound must be assigned a velocity
value

The Upper Toolbar
-----------------

The **Upper Toolbar** that runs along the top edge of the instrument
both in stand-alone and plug-in mode provides access to many useful
features. Let’s look at them in detail. The first seven of these options
can be found by clicking on the **Synclavier V** menu at the very top
left hand corner of the instrument window.

### Save

The first option lets you **Save** a preset timbre. If you have made a
change to the timbre you are presented with a window to enter
information about that timbre. You can **Name** the timbre, add an
**Author** name, select a **Bank** and **Type** and select some
**Characteristics** tags that describe the sound. This information can
be read by the **Preset Browser** and is useful for searching presets
later. You can also enter freeform text in the **Comments** field which
is handy for providing a more detailed description of your timbre.

### Save As…

This works in the same way as the **Save** command, but lets you save a
copy of the preset instead of saving over the original. It’s useful for
creating variations on patches but still keeping individual copies of
each one.

height="3.2758639545056867in"}

### Import… (Preset or Bank)

This command lets you import a Preset or Bank file. Presets and Banks
are stored in the .synx format.

height="2.5511220472440943in"}
![](images/image28.jpeg){width="4.586207349081365in"
height="2.562235345581802in"}

#### Export Preset…

You can export any preset as a file using this command. Click **Export
Preset (**and select a Preset) and a popup window will ask you where you
want to save it on your computer. Presets and Banks are stored in the
.synx format.

#### Export Bank

This option is used to export the entire bank of sounds from the
instrument. This is useful for backing up or sharing presets. From the
**Synclavier V** drop-down menu, click **Export Bank** and a popup
window will ask you where you want to save it on your computer.

### Resize Window

Synclavier V’s window can be resized from 60% to 200% of its original
size without any negative visual artifacts. On a smaller screen such as
a laptop you might want to reduce the interface size so it doesn’t
dominate the display. On a larger screen, or a second monitor, you can
increase its size to get a better view of the controls. The controls all
work the same at any zoom level but the smaller ones can be harder to
see if you have shrunk the window down.

height="3.6590824584426946in"}

### Audio settings

Here you manage the way the instrument transmits sound and receives
MIDI. (See section 2.2 of the manual for full details)

### About

Here you can view the Synclavier V software version, and designer
credits.

### Preset Browser Quick Look 

![](images/image30.jpeg){width="0.3388888888888889in"
height="0.3888888888888889in"}

Presets can be viewed by clicking on the **Preset Browser** button
**III\\** on the left side of the **Toolbar** (See Section 4.3 of the
manual for full details). The **All Types** name field and left & right
arrows &lt; &gt; in the toolbar also are used for preset selection.

### Display mode buttons

#### Standard Panel Mode

The **Standard Panel Mode** is a single panel of knobs and buttons above
the Virtual Keyboard. TIMBRE SETTINGS, AMP ENV OFFSET, HARM ENV OFFSET,
REPEAT/ARPEGGIO, POLYPHONIC MODE, AND PORTAMENTO sections control the
overall parameters of the current timbre selected. All Partial Timbres
are affected with these controls.

(See **Section 5** of the manual for complete detail on these controls)

![](images/image31.png){width="5.386111111111111in"
height="4.721406386701663in"}

#### Extended Panel Mode

The **Extended Panel Mode** can be viewed by clicking on the **EXT**
button at the top right of the **Upper** **Toolbar**. This lets you
access the 2nd panel of knobs and buttons which control each Partial
Timbre individually or in combinations. Click the **EXT** button again
and you will return to **Standard Panel Mode**.

(See **Section 6** of the manual for more complete detail on these
controls)

![](images/image33.png){width="5.409027777777778in"
height="4.827585301837271in"}

#### Graphic Screen Mode

The **Graphic Screen Mode** section can be viewed by clicking on the
button showing two downward pointing arrows at the top right of the
toolbar. This lets you access the more advanced features of the
instrument like tuning of individual notes, user waves and envelopes.

(See **Section 7** of the manual for complete detail on these controls)

![](images/image35.png){width="5.379166666666666in"
height="4.8390791776028in"}

### MIDI Learn Mode

![](images/image36.jpeg){width="0.3472222222222222in"
height="0.35555555555555557in"}

The MIDI plug icon at the right hand end of the toolbar places the
instrument into **MIDI Learn Mode**. Parameters that can be assigned to
MIDI controls will be shown in **Purple** and you can map physical MIDI
dials, faders or pedals from your hardware units (like the Arturia
**Beatstep** or **Keystep)** to specific destinations inside the
instrument. A typical example might be to map a hardware MIDI expression
pedal to the virtual Volume knob to control overall volume of an organ
or string timbre; or assign a button on a hardware controller to the
**Portamento** select switch so you can turn **Portamento** on/off of a
synth lead timbre.

![](images/image37.png){width="4.876288276465441in"
height="4.494844706911636in"}

When you click on a **Purple** knob or button you will put that control
into **Listening Mode**. Move a hardware dial, fader, or push a hardware
button and the target goes **Red** to show that a link has been made
between the hardware control and the software parameter. To
**un-assign** that parameter RIGHT-CLICK (2-finger Click on a Track Pad
or Smart Mouse) on the **Red** knob or parameter and it will return to
**Purple**.

There is a pop-up window called **MIDI Control Setup** that displays
which two things are being linked and a button to un-assign the two from
each other.

![](images/image38.png){width="4.257638888888889in"
height="3.6152777777777776in"}

The **MIN** (minimum) and **MAX** (maximum) value slider is used to
restrict the parameter change range to something other than 0%-100%. For
example, you might want the instrument’s Timbre Volume to be
controllable via hardware from 30% to 90%. If you made this setting (Min
set to 0.30 and Max set to 0.90), your physical dial would not alter the
volume any lower than 30% or any higher than 90% no matter how far you
turned it. This is very useful for making sure you can’t accidentally
make the sound too quiet or too loud when performing.

With buttons that have only two positions (up or down) you can still use
minimum and maximum values in the **MIDI Control Setup** pop-up window,
but in these cases the behavior is a little different.

It's about what values the controller sends and whether those are high
or low enough to trigger the state change in a switch - which is always
0.5 or in the case of the three stage switch, 33.3/33.3/33.3 (or near
enough). You can set the minimum and maximum values of the hardware MIDI
control but whether it affects the software parameter depends on whether
it crosses the threshold required to make the change.

Let's take an example. We want to control a 2-position button with a
hardware fader. The fader value goes from 0.0 to 1.0 and the switch
state will always change when 0.5 is crossed.

The **MIN** value in the **MIDI Control Setup** window corresponds with
the value that will be sent (from the controller to the engine) when the
fader is at its **minimum** position.

The **MAX** value in the **MIDI Control Setup** window corresponds with
the value that will be sent (from the controller to the engine) when the
fader is at its **maximum** position.

To explain this, try these 5 use cases:

-   Set **MIN** value to 0.0 and **MAX** value to 0.49 =&gt; the switch
    cannot be switched on because the 0.5 value can never be crossed.

-   Set **MIN** value to 0.51 and **MAX** value to 1.0 =&gt; the switch
    cannot be switched off because the 0.5 value can never be crossed.

-   Set **MIN** value to 0.0 and **MAX** value to 1.0 =&gt; the switch
    state changes when the fader crosses its central position.

-   Set **MIN** value to 0.49 and **MAX** value to 1.0 =&gt; the switch
    state changes when the fader is very low.

-   Set **MIN** value to 0.0 and **MAX** value to 0.51 =&gt; the switch
    state changes when the fader is very high.

The final option in this window is a button labeled “**Is Relative**”.
It is required to use “**Is Relative**” when using a Relative
controller, and to avoid using it with an Absolute controller.

Absolute and Relative controllers send Absolute and Relative data
respectively. When you move a physical Relative controller, the
parameter will start from its current position, sending either a “plus”
or “minus” message. When you move a physical Relative controller, the
controller sends a value between 0 (zero) and 127. The parameter will
jump, not to 0 (zero), but will pick up the **current** value of the
absolute controller.

#### Reserved MIDI CC numbers

Certain MIDI Continuous Controller (MIDI CC) numbers are reserved and
cannot be reassigned to other controls. These are:

-   PitchBend

-   Ctrl Mod Wheel (CC \#1)

-   Ctrl Expression (CC \#11)

-   AfterTouch

-   Ctrl Sustain On/Off (CC \#64)

-   Ctrl All Notes Off (CC \#123)

-   Ctrl All Sounds Off (CC \#120)

All other MIDI CC numbers may be used to control any assignable
parameter in Synclavier V.

### MIDI Controller Configs (Configurations)

**MIDI Controller Configs** are accessed at the far right hand side of
the **Upper Toolbar** just to the right of a MIDI Plug icon. It’s a
small down-facing arrow drop-down menu. **MIDI Controller Configs**
allow you to manage different sets of MIDI maps that you may have set up
for controlling the instrument’s parameters from MIDI hardware. You can
copy the current MIDI assignment setup or delete it, import a
configuration file or export the currently active one. This can be used
to quickly set up different hardware MIDI keyboards or controllers with
Synclavier V without having to build all the assignments from scratch
each time you swap hardware.

height="2.361111111111111in"}

The Lower Toolbar
-----------------

At the right hand side of the **Lower** **Toolbar** are 3 small items.

-   The MIDI channel button is a drop-down menu that assigns a MIDI
    channel that Synclavier V responds to. The default shows the
    selection as **ALL** or you can select between MIDI channels \#1-16.

-   The **PANIC** button resets all MIDI signals in the event of
    stuck-on notes, and stops sounds from being generated.

-   The **CPU** meter is used to monitor how much of your computer’

At the left hand side of the **Lower Toolbar** you will see a readout
showing the parameter value of the control you are modifying.

![](images/image40.png){width="5.970833333333333in"
height="1.1296675415573054in"}

The Preset Browser
------------------

![](images/image30.jpeg){width="0.4in"
height="0.4583333333333333in"}

The **Preset Browser** is how you search, load and manage Timbres/Sounds
in Synclavier V. It has a couple of different views but they all access
the same banks of presets. Click on the browser button that looks like
this III\\ to access the search view.

![](images/image44.png){width="6.0in"
height="5.281944444444444in"}

### Searching Presets

![](images/image46.png){width="6.0in"
height="2.908046806649169in"}

The **Search** display has a number of sections. By clicking on the
**Search** field at the top left you can quickly enter any search term
like “Pad” to filter the preset list by patch name. The Results column
is updated to show the results of your search. Press the X button in the
search field to clear the search.

### Filtering Using Tags

You can also search using different tags. For example, by clicking on
the **Lead** and **Organ** options in the **Types** field you can show
only presets that match those tags. The tag fields can be shown or
hidden by using the small down arrow buttons in their title fields.
Results columns can be sorted by clicking the same arrow button in their
own section.

You can use multiple search fields to perform narrower searches. So by
entering a text search and also specifying **Types**, **Banks** and
**Characteristics** options, you can see only the presets that match
those exact criteria. Deselect any tag in any area to remove that
criteria and widen the search without having to go back and start again.
Using “Ctrl + click” (Windows) or “Cmd + click” (Mac) will allow you to
select multiple elements in the same area.

The second **Results** column can be switched to show **Type**,
**Bank**, or **Designer**, tags depending on how you like to search.
Click on its options menu button just next to its sort arrow.

![](images/image47.png){width="6.0in" height="3.02919072615923in"}

### The Preset Info Section

The **Preset Info** column on the right of the search field shows
information about any preset. If you want to make changes to a factory
preset such as changing its name, adding comments or tags, you have to
re-save it as a user preset using the **Save As…** command in the main
**Synclavier V Menu**. When you have done this, the Info section will
gain Edit and Delete buttons that you can use to change the information
stored inside the preset. Factory presets can’t be overwritten.

### The Second Preset View

![](images/image49.png){width="1.6381944444444445in"
height="0.4in"}

The menu next to the Search menu shows you a different view. The default
view is **ALL TYPES**. The first option in this menu is called
**FILTER** and will hold a record of whatever you have currently
searched for in the Search field. So if you searched for Jazz in the
main search area, those results will appear here.

Selecting the **ALL TYPES** option in this column on the other hand will
provide a list of all patches. The Categories shown beneath group sounds
based on their Type like keys, pads, bass and so on.

![](images/image51.png){width="5.988888888888889in"
height="4.777083333333334in"}

Clicking on the name field in the center of the Toolbar will show you a
list of all available presets and will also change based on what you
have entered in the **Search** field. So again if you have searched for
“Jazz”, this shortcut menu will only show you patches that match that
tag. The left and right arrows in the **Toolbar** cycle up and down
through the preset list as either the full list, or the filtered list if
you have entered a search term.

### Playlists

In the lower left corner of the Preset Browser window is a feature
titled Playlists. This is used to collect presets into different groups
for different purposes, such as a set list for a particular performance
or a batch of presets related to a particular studio project.

#### Add a playlist

To create a playlist, click the plus sign at the bottom:

![](images/image52.png){width="3.875in"
height="2.2083333333333335in"}

Give the playlist a name and it will appear in the Playlists menu. You
can rename the playlist at any time; just click the pencil icon at the
end of its row.

#### Add a preset

You can use all of the options in the Search window to locate the
presets you want to have in your playlist. Once you have found the right
preset, click and drag it onto the playlist name.

![](images/image53.png){width="6.85in"
height="2.0652777777777778in"}

Click and drag from the Search Results list onto one of the playlists

To view the contents of a playlist, click on the playlist name.

#### Re-order the presets

Presets may be reorganized within a playlist. For example, to move a
preset from slot 2 to slot 4, drag and drop the preset to the desired
location.

This will move the preset into the new location.

#### Remove a preset

To delete a preset from a playlist, click the x at the end of the preset
row.

Click the X to remove a preset from a playlist

#### Delete a playlist

To delete a playlist, click the x directly to the right of the playlist
name.

Click the X to delete a playlist.
