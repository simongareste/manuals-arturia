Activation And First Start Up
=============================

Register and Activate
---------------------

Synclavier V works on computers equipped with Windows 7 or 8 and Mac OS
X 10.7 or later. You can use the stand-alone version or use Synclavier V
as an Audio Units, AAX, VST2 or VST3 instrument.

Once Synclavier V has been installed, the next step is to register the
software. The registration process will require you to enter the serial
number and the unlock code you received with the product.

In order to proceed, go to this web page and follow the instructions:

<http://www.arturia.com/register>

Note: If yo![](images/image21.png){width="6.607638888888889in"
height="5.390623359580053in"}u don’t have an Arturia account yet, you
will need to create one. The process is quick, but it does require that
you can access your email address during the registration process.

Once you have acquired an Arturia account you will be able to register
the product.

Initial setup
-------------

### Audio and MIDI Settings (Windows OS)

At the top left of the Synclavier V application is a drop-down menu. It
contains various setup options. Initially you will need to go to the
menu and choose the **Audio Settings** option to get sound and MIDI
flowing in and out.

When you choose the **Audio Settings** option, you will see the **Audio
MIDI** **Settings** window.

Starting from the top you have the following options:

-   **Device** lets you select which audio driver you want use to route
    sound out of the instrument. This might be your computer’s own
    driver like Windows Audio, or an ASIO driver. The name of your
    hardware interface may appear in this field.

-   **Output Channels** lets you select which of the available outputs
    will be used to route audio out. If you only have two outputs, only
    two will appear as options. If you have more than two you can select
    a specific pair of outputs.

-   **Buffer Size** lets you select the size of the audio buffer your
    computer uses to calculate sound. A smaller buffer means lower
    **latency** (delay) between pressing a key and hearing the note. A
    larger buffer means a lower CPU load as the computer has more time
    to think, but can result in a small **latency**. Find the optimum
    buffer size for your system. A fast, modern computer should easily
    be able to operate at 256 or 128 sample buffer size without creating
    pops or clicks in the sound. If you are getting clicks, try raising
    the buffer a little. The **latency** is displayed in milliseconds on
    the right hand side of this menu.

-   **Sample Rate** allows you set the sample rate at which audio is
    sent out of the instrument. The options here will depend on the
    capability of your audio interface hardware, though most computers’
    own hardware can operate at up to 48kHz which is perfectly adequate.
    Higher sample rates use more CPU power so unless you have a good
    reason to go up to 96kHz, then 44.1kHz or 48kHz are fine. The **Show
    Control Panel** button here will jump to the system control panel
    for whatever audio device is selected.

-   **Play Test Tone** helps you troubleshoot audio issues by checking
    that sound can be heard through the correct device.

-   Your connected MIDI devices will appear in the MIDI Devices area.
    Click the check box to accept MIDI from the device you want to use
    to trigger the instrument. In stand-alone mode, Synclavier V listens
    for all MIDI channels so there’s no need to specify a channel. You
    can specify more than one MIDI device at once.

### Audio and MIDI Settings (Mac OS X)

At the top left of the Synclavier V application is a drop-down menu. It
contains various setup options. Initially you will need to go to the
menu and choose the **Audio Settings** option to get sound and MIDI
flowing in and out.

When you choose the **Audio Settings** option, you will see the **Audio
MIDI** **Settings** window.

Starting from the top you have the following options:

-   **Device** lets you choose the audio driver you want to route sound
    out of the instrument. This will be either your Mac’s own driver,
    **CoreAudio**, or another driver. If you are using another hardware
    interface it will appear in this field.

-   **Output** **Channels** lets you select which of the available
    outputs will be used to route audio out. If you only have two
    outputs, only two will appear as options. If you have more than two
    you can select a specific pair of outputs.

-   **Buffer Size** lets you select the size of the audio buffer your
    computer uses to calculate sound. A smaller buffer means lower
    **latency** (delay) between pressing a key and hearing the note. A

    for whatever audio device is selected.

-   Play Test Tone helps you to troubleshoot audio issues by checking
    that sound can be heard through the correct device.

Your connected MIDI devices will appear in the MIDI Devices area. Click
the check box to accept MIDI from the device you want to use to trigger
the instrument. In stand-alone mode, Synclavier V listens for all MIDI
channels so there’s no need to specify a channel. You can specify more
than one MIDI device at once.

### Using Synclavier V in Plug-in Mode

Synclavier V comes in VST, AU and AAX plug-in formats for use in all
major DAW software like Cubase, Logic, Pro Tools and so on. You load it
as a plug-in instrument. Its interface and settings work in the same way
as in stand-alone mode, with a couple of differences.

-   The instrument will now synchronize to your DAW’s host tempo/bpm
    rate, when tempo is a factor. When you activate the Sync buttons on
    the front panel, VIBRATO rate, STEREO pan rate, and REPEAT/ARPEGGIO
    controls will synchronize to the DAW tempo/bpm.

-   You can automate numerous parameters using your DAW’s
    automation system.

-   You can use more than one instance of Synclavier V in a DAW project.
    In stand-alone mode you can only use one at a time.

-   You can route Synclavier V’s audio outputs more creatively inside
    your DAW using the DAW’s own audio routing system.
