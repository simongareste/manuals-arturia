Operation
=========

Master Controls
---------------

![](/images/media/image23.png)

These controls are always active, and they're not sent out or received
over MIDI.

- **Master Volume -** The synthesizer itself will not distort with the
level all the way up; the control is only to avoid overloading the next
step in the chain (mixer, audio interface, amp...).

- **Phones -** The headphone level is independent of the Master Volume.

- **Fine Tune** - Global tuning ± 1 semitone from the knob's center
detent.

Utility Commands
----------------

Pressing **Panel** plus another button invokes the following "hidden"
commands.

![]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/media/image24.png",
        "class":"col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"
        }
})

- **Panel + Kbd Track** - Auto-tunes the instrument. Because voltages
drift over time - which is part of the character of analog synths - it's
necessary to tune the instrument occasionally, more frequently while
it's first warming up.


![](/images/media/image25.png)

- **Panel + PRESET** - Resets the current preset to an initialized voice
(without saving it and overwriting the preset). This is a good starting
point for working with MatrixBrute.

- **Panel + MOD** - Clears the Matrix (which is the electronic patchbay)
of all modulation routings.

- **Panel + SEQ** - Resets the current pattern.

![](/images/media/image26.png)

- **Panel + \[Macro knobs, Master Cutoff, MOD Amount\]** - Resets the 360˚
knob's value to 0.

VCOs
----

Unless you bring in external instruments for processing, the raw
soundwaves for the MatrixBrute are generated by its three
Voltage-Controlled Oscillators (VCOs). A fourth oscillator produces
random noise waveforms.

VCOs 1 and 2 are exponential, like the ones on the most famous original
synthesizers. That gives them a musical, slightly unpredictable
character, because the pitch drifts a little over time. You may have to
auto-tune the instrument every once in a while (hold down Panel and
Keyboard Track).

VCO 3 is a multi-function oscillator. It can be used as a sound source
and as an extra modulator, and its pitch is more stable due to its being
linear.

### VCOs 1 and 2

![](/images/media/image13.png)

The only difference between these two VCOs is that VCO 1 can be routed
into VCO 2 to modulate it (this is called *frequency modulation*, or
FM). Both VCOs operate the same way.

The controls are laid out so the top knob refines the more fundamental
setting of the knob below it.

*Coarse* adjusts the pitch ± 2 octaves in semitone steps. The light
comes on when it is centered, when you're up or down one octave, and
when you reach two octaves.

*Fine* adjusts the pitch continuously up to ± 1 semitone.

### Sub oscillator

The sub oscillator is combined with the mixable waveforms (discussed
next), an octave below them.

*Sub* adjusts the level.

![](/images/media/image27.png)

The *waveform selection* knob above it sweeps the sub wavefom between a pure sinewave to the left and a clipped one, which sounds buzzier, to the right.

### Mixable waveforms

![](/images/media/image28.png)

There are three primary waveforms in VCOs 1 and 2 - sawtooth, square,
and triangle. Subjectively, sawtooth sounds the richest, square sounds
more hollow, and triangle sounds like a flute.

Each waveform knob has a signal enhancer above it. These make the
waveform more complex by combining slightly random, slightly
time-shifted versions of it.

- *Ultrasaw* enhances the sawtooth wave by combining two slightly
time-shifted copies of it, resulting in a brighter, edgier sound.

- *Pulse Width* varies the lengths of the flat tops and bottoms of the
square pulses - the width - so it's sometimes a rectangle rather than a
square, making the sound more complex.

- *Metalizer* adds a hard edge to the triangle wave. The Metalizer is a type of wave folder that adds harmonics to the original trianalge wave. 

### VCO 3 - LFO 3

![](/images/media/image29.png)

VCO 3 is a multifunction oscillator, designed to be used as a sound
source or as a modulation source. The Noise oscillator is next to it,
and it can also be used as a modulation source.

- *Coarse* adjusts the pitch ± 2 octaves in semitone steps. The light
comes on when it's centered, when you're up or down one octave, and when
you reach two octaves.

- *Wave* selects the waveform. Repeated button pushes go (from left to
right) between a reverse sawtooth, square, triangle, and sine wave. Each
sounds successively less buzzy, until you get to the pure sine wave.

- *LFO Div* divides the frequency by up to four (16, 32, 64, 128) when
it's being used as a modulator. This determines the LFO speed.

- *Kbd Track*, an on/off toggle, raises the output level of the oscillator
with successively higher notes. This simulates what happens with, for
example, woodwind and brass instruments.

###  Noise Generator

![](/images/media/image29.png)

The definition of noise is a random waveform, so it's unpitched. The MatrixBrute offers four noise types, and the difference is in their frequency spectrum.

As a practical description, blue noise has the most energy in the high frequencies and least in the low ones, then white sounds a little lower, followed by pink, and finally red sounds the lowest. Noise can be an important component of a sound, adding some grit, or it can be used to modulate another wave.

Noise Type selects the four types successively, and each one has an appropriately colored light.


Audio Mod
---------

![](/images/media/image30.png)

In addition to making sounds, the VCOs can modulate other VCOs and the two VCFs (Voltage-Controlled Filters). These will create more character and add harmonics to the sound of the modulation destination. 

When the VCOs modulate other VCOs, it's called Frequency Modulation -
FM.

- **VCO 1 &gt; VCO 2** adjusts how much VCO 1 modulates VCO 2.

- **VCO 1 &lt; VCO 3 &gt; VCO 2** lets VCO 3 modulate VCO 1 or 2. It
modulates neither when the knob hits its center detent.

- **VCF 1 &lt; VCO 3 &gt; VCF 2** lets VCO 3 modulate VCF 1 or 2. It
modulates neither filter when the knob is in its center detent.

- **VCO 1 &lt; Noise &gt; VCF 1** lets the Noise oscillator modulate VCO 1
or VCF 1. Again, it does neither when the knob is centered in the
detent.

For the bi-polar knobs to be used in the modulation matrix, you will need to turn the knob in the direction that you want it to modulate when assigning it. There is a small dead zone on either side of the center detent that will allow you to have no modulation but still allow the knob position to be sensed.

VCO Sync
--------

**VCO 2 &gt; VCO 1** causes VCO 1 to follow VCO 2's pitch when it's
engaged. Turning VCO 1’s Coarse knob will allow you to hear the classic
harmonic sync sweep sound.

Voice Mode
----------

![](/images/media/image31.png)

There are 3 VOICE modes that are available on the MatrixBrute. These
modes allow you to play the synth in ways beyond the standard monophonic
way.

### Monophonic

Monophonic is the standard voice mode. In this mode, all the oscillators will play when you press a key ( or send MIDI or CV information ). The voice path is laid out as you see it in the graphics below.

### Paraphonic

Paraphonic mode allows you to play multiple notes at one time. It splits the three oscillators, one per note played, so that you can play up to 3 notes at once. Paraphonic differs from polyphonic in that all 3 of the oscillators share the same filters and VCA settings.

### Duo Split mode

Duo split mode allows you to split the keyboard and have 2 completely different sounds played on each half. To accomplish this, we split the voice up as shown in the diagram below. 

#### Upper part

Signals routed through VCF 1 (the Steiner filter), are controlled by
ENV 1 and ENV 2.

#### Lower Part

- Signals routed to VCF 2 (the Ladder filter); are controlled by ENV 3
which then controls both the Ladder filter and a hidden VCA.

- The Sequencer and Arpeggiator are routed to the lower part, so you can
hold a key to play a pattern or arpeggio on the lower part of the
keyboard while playing notes on the top part.

#### Setting the split point

Set the split point by pressing **MODE** button while playing a key.
(This is the MODE button in the VOICE panel area, not one of the filter
mode buttons.)

#### Setting the octave of the lower section

Set the octave of the lower part by pressing **MODE** button and use
the Octave &lt;- -&gt; buttons to transpose it.

![](/images/media/image32.png)

Wheels
------

![](/images/media/image31.png)

- **Wheels** As on most keyboards, the MatrixBrute's pitch wheel springs
back to the center position (no pitch shift), while the mod wheel is
continuous.

- **Bend Range** sets how far the pitch wheel bends up or down, up to a
maximum of ± 1 octave. The center position is up or down a fifth.

- **Mod Wheel** - successive pushes assign the mod wheel to the **Matrix**
(where it can be routed to multiple parameters); or to the master filter
**Cutoff** frequency; to **LFO 1 Vib**rato rate; or to **LFO 1 amount**.

Keyboard Performance Controls
-----------------------------

![](/images/media/image33.png)

- **Pitch and Modulation wheels** - Please refer to the previous section
(WHEELS) to set the pitch bend range and Modulation wheel assignment.

- **Octave &lt;- -&gt;** - Transposes the entire 49-key keyboard ± 1 or 2
octaves to extend its range past four octaves. This affects the
instrument locally as well as over MIDI.

### Glide

- **Glide On/Off** - The Glide effect sweeps the pitch from one note to
the next. The ON/OFF button enables and disables the glide function.

- **Glide** - This knob sets the glide time from barely perceptible all
the way to over two seconds when it's all the way up.

### Play Control

- *Legato* **–** Legato allows for playing notes with or without
retriggering the envelopes on every key on. The following settings apply
to each note sounding in the current voice mode. In Monophonic they
apply to the single sound, and in Paraphonic and Duo-Split they apply to
the one being played. [See the Voice Mode section ](#voice-mode).

- *On -* This will only retrigger the envelope after all notes have been
released. Holding a note while playing the next one, before releasing
the first, creates a slur effect. This works for successive notes as
well, and its effect is dependent on the envelope settings (because a
sound's overall length is relative to the first note you play). If you
play staccato, the envelope will trigger on each note played as normal.

- *Off* – Every note played will trigger the envelopes.

- *Glide* - This mode is similar to Legato mode in the playing a notes
while a note is held, will not trigger then envelopes. If the GLIDE is
active, then playing legato will both prevent the envelope from
triggering as well as gliding from one pitch to the next.

**Note Priority** - Determines what happens when you play more voices
than are available (one in Monophonic voice mode and two in the other
voice modes).

- *Low -* The lowest note you're holding keeps sustaining and other notes
are cut off;

- *High -* The highest note you're holding keeps sustaining and other
notes are cut off;

- *Last -* Held notes are cut off by the new ones you play.

**Key Hold** – Simulates the effect of holding a note forever. It plays
the last note you triggered, no matter how much time has passed, and
holds it. It does not affect the envelopes so sounds with no sustain
will not actually sound beyond the decay time. This is also used to hold
an arpeggiation on.

Macro Knobs
-----------

![Macro Knobs]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/media/image34.png",
        "class":"col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-4",
        "title":"Macro Knobs"
        }
})

**M1, M2, M3, and M4** knobs are modulation sources that appear the MOD
Matrix ( [see Mode Matrix Section](#mod-mode) ) on rows M, N, O, and P. They're designed to be
convenient performance controls.

Each MACRO knob can modulate multiple MatrixBrute parameters, and they
all send MIDI Continuous Controllers (CC\#11, 2, 3, 4 in order).

![](/images/media/image35.png)

#### Resetting Macro’s to 0

Press **Panel + \[M1 - M4\]** to reset the MACRO knob to 0.

Mixer
-----

![Mixer Knobs]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/media/image36.png",
        "class":"col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-4",
        "title":"Mixer Knobs"
        }
})

The levels of the MatrixBrute's five potential sound sources - the VCOs,
Noise generator, and External input - are set here. Sources must be sent
to either or both filters to be heard.

(If you've assigned a source to one of the filters and still hear
nothing, the cutoff frequency may be outside its range.)

All five inputs to the mixer have the same features:

- **Level** \[VCO 1, VCO 2, VCO 3, Noise, External\]

- **Filter routing -** Press the button repeatedly to assign the sound
source to VCF 1, VCF 2, both, or neither. If the filters are in series,
the VCOs can only be assigned to VCF 1 (or turned off).

In Duo split mode, the routing here will assign the sound source to
either the upper (Steiner) or lower (Ladder) section of the keyboard.

LFOs 1 and 2
------------

![](/images/media/image37.png)

The two LFOs (low frequency oscillators) are modulators that can be
routed to add movement to pretty much any parameter on the MatrixBrute.
LFO waveforms are near or below the bottom threshold of our hearing,
ranging from about one cycle every 18 seconds up to 100Hz. They're
useful for creating all kinds of sounds, from vibrato to filter sweeps
to pitch changes; their effects range from subtle to wild.

![](/images/media/image38.png)

Seven waveforms are available, from left to right: sine, triangle,
square, reverse sawtooth, sawtooth, S&H, and low frequency random.

The pictures of these waveforms show exactly how they behave, for
example the square wave turns on and off abruptly and the triangle ramps
up and back down. You can hear this very clearly at slow rates.

- **Wave Selection -** &lt; and &gt; scroll left and right through the
waveforms.

LFO 1 and 2 are the same except for one similar parameter (Phase vs.
Delay), and you patch them into the signal path at the Matrix. [See
Matrix Section](#the-matrix).

- **Phase \[LFO 1 only\]** adjusts where in the LFO's wave cycle it starts
relative to the note trigger, either early or late. The knob has center
detent position to starts the LFO at the beginning.

- **Delay \[LFO 2 only\]** delays when LFO starts and also fades it in
gradually.

- **Rate** sets the frequency of the LFO. The light to the left of this
knob flashes with it (until the setting gets too high and the light
remains solid).

- **Seq-Sync** locks the LFO's tempo to the Sequencer [See Sequencer Section](#sequencer-mode),
which in turn can be synced to various sources.

- **Retrig** cycles through the three choices for how the LFOs respond to
note triggers/retriggers:

 - *Off* - The LFO keeps oscillating continuously on its own, independently
of whether notes are triggered; This mode simulates a traditional analog
LFO.

 - *Single* **-** The LFO goes through its wave one time only after a note
is triggered. This is useful for creating an interesting note attack,
among other applications.

 - *Multi* **-** The LFO starts its cycle over every time you trigger a
note.

Filters
-------

**Steiner Filter (VCF 1) and Ladder Filter (VCF 2)**

![](/images/media/image39.png)

Filters remove frequencies from the sound sources coming from the Mixer
[see Mixer Section](#mixer), and they are a primary component in the subtractive
synthesis technique used by the MatrixBrute and all analog synths.
Modulating them varies the timbre of the sound over time. With very high
Resonance levels they can self-oscillate, becoming another sound source.

MatrixBrute features two multimode Voltage-Controlled Filters (VCFs):

- The **Steiner Filter (VCF 1)** was designed by Nyle Steiner in the
'70s. It has a unique character that becomes apparent immediately at
relatively pronounced settings.

- The other filter is a classic **Ladder Filter (VCF 2)**, a famous standard-bearing design known for its rich, thick sound; unlike the original, this one is gain-compensated to avoid the dip in volume that you find at higher resonance level. This one also is a multimode filter and has both 12dB per octave and 24dB per octave options. These filters play a big role in the
MatrixBrute's character.

Both filters have the same basic parameters, but the Steiner Filter has
a couple of additional ones.

The central parameter in a filter is the corner frequency or frequencies
where it starts cutting. This is called Cutoff in synths. Maxibrute has
two places to adjust this:

- **Cutoff** sets the corner frequency/frequencies individually for each
filter. These are then fed to a combined control:

- **Master Cutoff** is a prominent knob that sweeps both filters' cutoffs
together.

The word "multimode" means the filter can adopt different curves, which
also change the sound completely.

**Mode** selects these curves:

- *LP (Lowpass)* does just that - allow low frequencies to pass while
high frequencies are attenuated.

- *BP (Bandpass)* allows a band of frequencies to pass while blocking
everything else. Another way to look at it is that the treble and bass
are turned down, leaving a midrange band.

- *HP (Highpass)* allows high frequencies to pass while low frequencies
are blocked.

- *Notch (Steiner/Parker filter only)* removes a narrow band of
frequencies.

The slope of the filter's roll-off changes the sharpness of the sound.

- **Slope** selects either the **12dB** or **24dB** per octave setting.
Usually 12dB sounds brighter.

- **Drive** adjusts how hard the signal hits the filter. The higher you
set it, the more pleasant distortion you get.

- **Brute Factor™** is Arturia secret sauce. It ranges from warming up the low end to creating a monstrous growl when turned up. The exact effect depends on how it's interacting with other settings.

- **Resonance** emphasizes the frequencies at the point of the cutoff, because they're fed back into the circuit. Higher resonance levels can cause the filters to self-oscillate. NOTE: The Steiner filter does not track the keyboard well over a wide range by nature. For better pitch to octave tracking, using the Ladder filter.

- **Env 1 Amt** sets how much Envelope 1 (the one dedicated to the VCFs) modulates the Cutoff frequency. This control allows for both positive and negative modulation amounts.

- **Routing** chooses between the two filters running in parallel or having VCF 1 feed VCF 2. This unique control allows you to alter the voice path and create a wealth of new sounds. 

Envelopes
---------

![]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/media/image40.png",
        "class":"col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-4"
        }
})

Envelopes are adjustable modulators that shape the voltage over time. MatrixBrute has two 4-stage, ADSR (Attack Decay Sustain Release) envelopes, plus a third one (ENV 3) which adds a Delay phase before the ADSR (this is all explained below). Each envelope has a "gate" LED that show when a gate is receive and will fade out to show when the release stage is still active.

You can add assignments to the envelopes in the Matrix, but by default:

- **ENV 1 (VCF)** is routed to the VCF's Master Cutoff frequency, so you
can shape the overall filter sweep;

- **ENV 2 (VCA)** (voltage-controlled amplifier) controls the overall
volume level of the sound;

- **ENV 3** is freely assignable in the Matrix.

![]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/media/image20.png",
        "class":"col-xs-41"
        }
})


In all three envelopes:

- **Attack** sets the time, from 2ms to more than 10 seconds, the voltage takes to reach its initial level;

- **Decay** adjusts the time, again from 2ms to more than 10 seconds, it takes the voltage to go from its initial level to the Sustain level;

- **Sustain** is the level the signal settles at after it decays. This
level is usually lower than the initial level (hence "decay"), however
it can also be the same - in which case the Decay setting has no effect.
It can also be all the way down, for example if you're programming
percussive sounds, in which case the Release setting has no effect.

- **Release** is the time it takes the voltage to fade all the way down
after you release the key that's triggering the sound.

- **Velo/VCF and Velo/VCA (ENV 1 and ENV 1 only)**: You can tune ENV 1's
and ENV 2's response to key velocity, i.e. the "louder" you play, the
higher the signal voltage. (Unlike pianos, electronic keyboards measure
how fast a key travels - its velocity - to determine how loudly you
intended to play.)

- **Velo/VCF (ENV 1 only)** This slider offsets the ADSR levels so
velocity has no effect when it's all the way down; the higher you raise
it, the more velocity is required to reach the maximum filter Cutoff
level.

- **Velo/VCA (ENV 2 only)** When this slider's all the way down, the VCOs
sound at their maximum level, no matter how hard or softly you play;
raise the slider to increase the keyboard velocity response.

- **ENV 3** is slightly different in two ways. First, it doesn't do
anything until it's assigned in the Matrix. Second, it runs through its
stages independently of keyboard velocity (although you can modulate its
stages in the Matrix).

 - *Delay (ENV 3 only)* allows you to start ENV3 envelope after the key trigger; all the way down is no delay. The delay time is from 2mSec to over 10 Seconds.

Analog Effects
--------------

![](/images/media/image42.png)

MatrixBrute features Analog Effects with 5 different modes on the output. 

The Analog Effects are all based on classic Bucket Brigade Devices (BBD’s). The technical differences between them are a function of the delay times and how or whether they're modulated. Note that all the knobs can be modulation destinations in the Matrix.

**Mode** cycles through the five effects, which are tuned with the five
knobs at the top of the Analog Effects section:

- *Stereo Delay* has two taps (meaning repetitions of the original sound),
first left then right. When the Delay Time knob (see below) is at 12
o'clock, the first one is about 100ms and the second about 200ms. The
maximum time is about half a second.

- *Mono Delay* is a single tap in the center (i.e. it's equal in both left
and right sides).

- *Chorus* is an LFO modulated delay, in the vicinity of 5 to 50ms. It's a
rich, thickening sound.

- *Flange* is a shorter modulated delay, somewhere around .5 to 10ms.
Typically, flangers have an "airplane" sound, and unlike choruses the
effect often moves in and out.

- *Reverberator* is a unique analog space effect, produced by recirculating the delays with varying delay times.

The five effect-modifying parameters:

- **Delay Time** has different ranges in different Modes. Longer delay times are achieved with clockwise turns.

- **Regeneration** is a level control for the amount of the signal that
gets fed back into the processor. Things can get wild - in both good and
bad ways - if you turn it up.

- **Tone/Rate** This control doubles as a tone or lowpass filter control for the delays, and as a rate control in the Chorus and Flanger modes. 

- **Width/Depth** specifies the amount of stereo field in the stereo
delay/reverberator, and the modulation depth of the LFO in the chorus
and flanger.
