# Getting Started with MatrixBrute

![](/images/matrixbrute/image4.png)

With the MatrixBrute on a solid playing surface, push the **Panel
Release** latch and use the hinged prop inside to set the control panel
at the most convenient angle (or just leave it flat if that works
better). Take care when lifting on the Matrixbrute panel as it could
cause the support to fall.

        "title":"Back View"
        }
})

In order to hear the instrument, connect cables from the Master Out to
your amp and speakers. Use the left output for mono, i.e. if you're only
using one cable. (You can also just use headphones - the jack is on the
left side of the front edge, by the wheels.)

**Register and update first:** MatrixBrute is designed so it can work
stand-alone, but it also brings some very useful features to a computer
environment.

Please use a USB-B to USB-A cable to connect it to a Mac or PC when
you first get it.

![MIDI CC]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/matrixbrute/image6.png",

        "title":"MIDI CC"
        }
})
Then go to www.arturia.com and download the MIDI Control Center
software for Mac and PC. Arturia is constantly improving our
instruments, so we ask that you update to the latest firmware (which you
do through this program).

MIDI Control Center is a librarian for presets and sequences, and it's
used to configure the instrument's MIDI settings.

**MIDI:** In addition to the keyboard, almost all the knobs and sliders
send and respond to MIDI, so you can record and edit them in a DAW. This
also makes the instrument useful as a hands-on controller for other
instruments. MIDI can go in and out the USB port, the 5-pin DIN ports,
both, or neither.

For details about which MIDI Continuous Controllers each fader and
knob sends/receives, please [see the section on MIDI](#midi). 

**Auto-Tuning MatrixBrute**

Summary: **Kbd Track + Panel** *auto-tunes the instrument. You'll
need to do that once in a while, more often before it warms up.*

Part of the beauty of analog synths like the MatrixBrute is that the
voltage running through their circuitry drifts a small amount, giving
them a slightly random character. It also takes a while for the voltage
to stabilize when you first turn the synth on; the warmer the
temperature, the shorter the time it takes, but you'll still need to
auto-tune the instrument from time to time.

Hold down **Kbd Track** and **Panel** to initiate the auto-tuning
process.

**Understanding Digitally-Controlled Analog**

Summary: *The knobs and sliders don't necessarily reflect the
underlying settings. There are some different behavior settings in the
MIDI Control Center software, but in the default mode you must sweep the
knob past its actual setting to "hook" it.*

Unlike early analog synths, MatrixBrute has the advantage of digital
control over its analog circuitry. It's the best of both worlds: the
warmth and hands-on control of real analog, with the ability to save and
recall patches and settings - to say nothing of the Matrix (electronic
patchbay), MIDI, and other modern conveniences.

Because of that, the instrument's knobs and sliders aren't actually controlling voltages directly, they are knobs that instruct the digital circuitry how to control the analog voltages. So the positions you see on the panel don't necessarily reflect where they're really set, for example after you load a Preset sound.

The MIDI Control Center software has three modes. In Hook mode you must sweep the knob until it catches its actual position before it has any effect. Jump mode means the voltage jumps to the knob position as soon as you move it; and Scaled mode scales the range of the knob based on the stored value and the physical distance to either extreme.

The Panel button mentioned above will bypass the current preset and give you a sound that is based on the actual positions of the knobs and sliders.

**Load a Preset, Play, and Adjust the Output Level**

        "class":"col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2"
        }
})

Press PRESET, and the button will turn purple.

        "class":"col-xs-8 col-xs-offset-2"
        }
})

Push a button to load a Patch so you can play the instrument. Adjust the
output and/or headphone levels, and fine-tune the pitch.

(*Be sure the Panel button mentioned above isn't lit, or you won't be
listening to the Preset*.)

MatrixBrute stores 16 banks of 16 Presets (total 256). The banks are
rows A - P on the left, Presets within each bank are in columns 1-16. To
select, say, patch B3, go two rows down and three columns across; B 03
will appear in the numeric display.

(The Matrix is also used for the 64-step pattern sequencer/arpeggiator,
and when you push MOD it becomes the electronic patchbay.)
