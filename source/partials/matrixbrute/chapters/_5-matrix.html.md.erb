# The Matrix

![](/images/matrixbrute/image43.png)

The Matrix is a 16 x 16 (256-button) grid that has three modes.

![](/images/matrixbrute/image44.png)

**PRESET** (pink)**, SEQ** (red)**,** and **MOD** (blue) are big buttons
to select the active Matrix mode:

- **PRESET**, in which the Matrix is used to save and recall patches in
16 banks (rows A - P) of 16 patches each (columns 1-16). The patches can
also include sequences.

- **SEQ**, a 64-step sequencer that also functions as an arpeggiator.

- **MOD**, an electronic patching matrix (hence the name "MatrixBrute")
that routes 16 modulation sources (rows A-P) to 16 destinations (columns
1 - 16).

##  PRESET mode

### Panel 

Panel toggles between the physical and loaded preset positions.

When in this mode, the positions of the knobs determine the sound. This is the mode to use if you are looking to get 1:1 feedback of parameters and the sound you are editing.

IMPORTANT: to hear a preset you've loaded, the Panel button must be off!

### Recalling internal presets

**To recall one of the 256 internal presets:**

In PRESET mode, simply select its button. The banks are rows A - P on
the left, and presets within each bank are columns 1-16. To select, say,
patch B3, go two rows down and three columns across; B 03 will appear in
the numeric display. Alternatively, use the **&lt;** and **&gt;**
buttons underneath the numeric display to scroll up and down through the
presets.

### Saving a preset

**To save the Panel or edited Preset in an internal location:**

Press **Save** + \[**desired bank/channel location**, using the Matrix
buttons or **&lt;** and **&gt;** buttons\].

## MOD mode

![](/images/matrixbrute/image46.png)

The **MOD**ulation Matrix is an electronic patchbay that routes all the MatrixBrute's modulation sources to any or all possible destinations. Think of this as a grid of patch cords, each with an attenuator that allows for positive or negative modulation. Every parameter that it would make sense to modulate - pretty much anything with a knob or fader - can be a destination.

The 16 modulation sources are in rows A - P, and destinations are in columns 1 - 16. Destinations 1 - 12 are hardwired, and 13 - 16 are freely assignable. 


### Create a modulation path

**To assign a modulation source to a destination parameter:**

1. In MOD mode, select a modulator and a destination by pressing any
button in the grid.

 - The current selection lights up pink.

 - You can select from 0 to all 16 destinations for each modulation
source, and each destination parameter can be modulated by 0 to 16
sources.

 - Modulation "patch points" light up blue when they're not the current
selection.

2. Set a positive or negative modulation amount (± 99 steps) for the
current selection with the **Mod Amount** knob. This is an offset from
the input voltage.

Negative values decrease a destination's MOD Amount as the input voltage
goes up, positive values increase it. For example, you might want
Aftertouch to lower VCO 1's pitch a small amount while increasing VCO
1's Metal a lot.

### Setting the modulation amount

When **MOD Amount** is centered, only the red LED at 12 o'clock is lit.
White LEDs in either direction indicate the knob's position when it's
off-center; each dot gets progressively brighter when you've moving
toward it.

![](/images/matrixbrute/image47.png)

Also, the exact modulation amount is shown in the numeric display in the
Preset area.

### User assignable destinations

**To assign a parameter to destinations 13 - 16:**

![]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/matrixbrute/image48.png",
        "class":"col-xs-4 col-xs-offset-4"
        }
})

Hold \[**13, 14, 15, or 16**\] button while moving the desired knob or
slider on the front panel. The parameter will appear in the LCD display
as shown above.

You can also assign a modulation amount in the matrix itself as a modulation destination by pressing and holding the [13, 14, 15, or 16] button and pressing a button in the modulation grid. 

For instance:

If you wanted to have the mod wheel adjust the amount of modulation between the LFO2 and the Metalizer of VCO1, you would first route the LFO2 to the Metalizer of VCO1 by pressing the F4 button. Then you would select F4 as a modulation destination by pressing the [13 for example] button and the F4 button. Now you would choose MOD Wheel to F4 by pressing the H13 button and using the encoder to turn up this value.


**List of MOD sources:**


|#|MOD source|Notes| 
|------|-----|-----|
| A |  ENV 1  |       | 
|  B |  ENV 2    |    |       
|  C |  ENV 3    |        |   
|  D |  ENV Follow    |   Generates a control voltage based on the level of the external input. |  
|  E |  LFO 1 |            |  
|  F |  LFO 2   |         |  
|  G | LFO 3   |         |  
|  H |  Mod Wheel   |      |  
|  I |  Kbd/ Seq      |   Note triggers from the keyboard or SEQuencer |
|  J | Aftertouch   |    The keys are pressure-sensitive when you keep pushing after the note is triggered. |
|  K |  Velocity      |   Electronic keyboards measure how fast a key travels to determine how loudly you intended to play. |
|  L  | Seq Mod   |       Mod from the SEQuencer |
| M  | M1       |        Macro knob M1 |
|  N | M2      |         Macro knob M2 |
| O |  Exp 1/M3    |     Expression pedal plugged into the rear panel, and Macro knob M3.  | 
|  P  | Exp 2/M4  |       Expression pedal plugged into the rear panel, and Macro knob M4.  | 

Note that both the Expression pedal and the M 3 or 4 are summed before being routed to the matrix

SEQUENCER Mode
---------

![](/images/matrixbrute/image49.png)

MatrixBrute's 64-step sequencer has two modes: Sequencer and
Arpeggiator.

In Sequencer mode, you can record/program and play Patterns in real time or in "step" time, meaning one note at a time. Patterns can be Linked to a corresponding preset so that they are stored with Presets, or stored and recalled on their own. Play or step through patterns forward, backward, forward then backward, in random order, and at different note values (e.g. if each step is an 1/8th note, switch it to 1/4 notes to halve the playback speed, etc.).

When the sequencer is being used as a modulation source and routed in
the Matrix, each step can send (or not send) modulation. Dial in the
tempo, tap it, or sync it to incoming MIDI clock. Slide one step into
the next one. Steps respond to key velocity, and you can enter accents
manually.

In **Arpeggiator** mode the notes you hold down are stepped through in a variety of orders, and repeated in higher octaves.

![](/images/matrixbrute/image50.png)

Press **Sequencer**) to enter Sequencer mode.

**Loading and saving sequencer Patterns:**

- *Patterns* - You can load and play different sequences, or pattern, by
holding the PATTERNS buttons and choosing from any of the 256
sequences. The banks are rows A - P on the left, and presets within each
bank are in columns 1-16. To load, say, Pattern B3, go two rows down and
three columns across; the B3 red light shows you which sequence is
loaded.

- *Link* - you can link a sequence to your preset sound. When saving your
preset, enable the LINK button to store them together.

- *Save* - Just hold this button and select the bank/preset where you
want to save the Pattern. *Turn on* **Link** *to save a Pattern with a
Preset.* [See Matrix Preset Section](#preset-mode)

- *SEQ Length* To set the sequence length, i.e. the number of steps up to
64 maximum, hold SEQ Length and touch any of the four buttons in the
last step to be played. They'll light up, and after that the sequence
will cycle back to the beginning when it gets there (assuming you don't
stop it first, and that it's playing forward rather than backward or
random).

![Seq]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/matrixbrute/image51.png",
        "class":"col-xs-8"
        },
    "img2":{
    "link":"/images/matrixbrute/image52.png",
    "class":"col-xs-3"
    }
})

#### Step parameters:

The sequencer's 64 steps are in four 4-button rows of 16.

- **Step** indicates a trigger on that step (when it's lit red). See the
**Record** button below for instructions on how to program patterns, but
you can push the button to turn a programmed/recorded note off. 
To tie several steps together, hold the first step button and press the last step one. All step buttons but the first are dimmed (darker).

- **Accent** lights automatically when you enter or record a note at
higher velocities, or you can turn it on to create an accent. This is
used in conjunction with the VELOCITY sliders on the ENV 1 (VCF) and ENV
2 (VCA).

- **Slide** activate the GLIDE enable button and will allow you to slide
from one note to another.

- **MOD** toggles modulation on and off for the step. It has to be
routed to a parameter in the modulation Matrix to have an effect, and it
can do all kinds of interesting things.

#### Sequencer transport and Pattern recording/programming

![](/images/matrixbrute/image53.png)

- *&lt; and &gt;* locate the transport backward or forward one step (when
it's stopped) and trigger the note on the step. (They have a different
function in Arpeggiator mode. See below.)

- *Record* **-** (Lights up red.) This
works independently of whether the transport is moving. When it's
moving, your playing is recorded in real time. If it's pushed when the
transport is stopped, press any of the 64 step buttons and whatever note
you play will be recorded on that step (at the velocity you play). The
button turns pink to indicate the current step.
You can record over any note(s) in a sequence, and you can turn off
individual notes simply by pushing their buttons.

- *Play from beginning* **-** (Lights up
white.) This works under any condition - transport moving or stopped,
Record active, etc.

- *Play/stop/continue* **-** (Lights up
green.) This also works under any condition.

![](/images/matrixbrute/image57.png)

- **"Auto-play" feature:** When the Sequencer button is lit, the pattern
will start to play, and continue as long you hold a note on the
keyboard. **Play from beginning** lights up, and the pattern continues
until you release the note. Play the note again, and the pattern starts
over from the beginning.

**NOTE:** *The pattern auto-plays its programmed pitches if you play
middle C, but it transposes if you play another note (and if you play
subsequent notes, it transposes again without stopping, provided you
connect the notes closely enough). For that reason, it's a good idea to
program/record patterns with C as the base note.*

- **Tempo, rate, and playback controls**

**NOTE:** *These apply to both Sequencer and Arpeggiator modes.*

![](/images/matrixbrute/image50.png)

**MIDI Sync** ignores the internal tempo and locks the Sequencer and
Arpeggiator to incoming MIDI clock. Use this if you're using the
MatrixBrute with a MIDI sequencer or other MIDI equipment. 
External Sync may come from three sources: MIDI In, MIDI over USB and Sync port. You can choose the source you wish to use with the MIDI Control Center.

![](/images/matrixbrute/image58.png)

- *Gate* sets the on/off length of each step, on a scale from 1 to 99. At
99, each note trigger is held until the following step.

- *Swing* delays every odd-numbered step to create a shuffle rather than a
straight pattern. 50% is no swing, 75% is maximum swing. With 8th notes,
for example, 50% swing gives you even 8th notes, and the more swing you
add, the closer you get to a dotted 8th followed by a 16th note.

- *Rate* dials in the sequencer tempo, from 30 to 259.9. The tempo is
shown in the display. When sync’d to MIDI, the rate knob will increment
in exact divisions of time based on the incoming clock.

- *Tap* this button to tap in the tempo. The sequencer engine updates with
every tap, so you can keep tapping if you need to follow a drifting
tempo, and result is shown in the display. Taps are relative to the
current note value (see the following topic), so if you're set to
quarter notes, each tap is a quarter note. If you're set to 1/8th note
triplets, each tap is one of those, and do on.

**Note value buttons**

![](/images/matrixbrute/image59.png)

These playback settings determine what note value each step is, relative
to the playback tempo. If you're using the MatrixBrute on its own, this
will simply change the playback speed in a predictable way. But if
you're locking the tempo to MIDI clock, it will change the musical value
of each step in the sequencer or arpeggiator.

From left to right, the three buttons with musical notes represent
"straight" notes, triplets, and dotted notes. The "fraction" buttons
below them determine what value the musical notes are.

Examples:

- 1/4 + &#9833; means each step is a quarter note;

- 1/8 + &#9833; makes each step an eighth note;

- 1/8 + &#9833;&#9833;&#9833; will make each step an 1/8th note
triplet;

- 1/16 + &#9833;. ...that's going to make each step a dotted
1/16th.

### Arpeggiator mode

![](/images/matrixbrute/image63.png)

**Arpeggiator** enters this mode, in which the notes you hold are
automatically stepped through one at a time. You can hold down as many
keys as your hands or even forearms will cover; each note you hold
lights up a red step in the Matrix.

![](/images/matrixbrute/image64.png)

The yellow lettering underneath buttons applies to the arpeggiator.

- **Up** steps through the notes from lowest to highest and repeats;

- **Dwn** steps through them from highest to lowest and repeats;

- **Up/Down** does just that: play from lowest to highest and back down;

- **Rand** plays the held notes in random order.

- **Octave &gt;** Each push of this button causes the arpeggiator to
repeat the up/down or random sequence an additional octave higher, up to
three octaves, and **&lt;** subtracts an octave with each push. The
setting is shown in the display.

### Matrix Arpeggiator Mode

*Press both Sequencer and Arpeggiator.*

This mode lets you hold up to four notes and play them in any order, in the octave you set for each note, up to 16 steps. You can also vary the rhythm of the arpeggio up to 16 steps.

![Play]({
    "img":{
        "link":"/images/matrixbrute/image65.jpg",
        "class":"col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1"
        }
})

You can hold down any four notes (or fewer), in the example above,  Ab-C-E-G are being arpeggiated in the pattern shown, use the blue buttons to shift the specific note of your arpeggio up or down within the three octaves. The red line shows the steps, i.e. the rhythm pattern.

In addition, you can use chromatic approach notes:
 
- Lower approach note: If you hold the < transport control while pressing a button in the octave section, the note sent is one half step below, and the button turns red instead of blue

- Upper approach note: If you hold the > transport control while pressing a button in the octave section, the note sent is one half step above, and the button turns purple instead of blue
